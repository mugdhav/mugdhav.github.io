00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,718
Hello everyone, and welcome. Thank you

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:05,337
for joining us today for this

3
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,955
conversation on a topic that is

4
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:09,700
becoming increasingly important for

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,319
everyone working with content. As AI

6
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:14,937
reshapes how people discover and use

7
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:17,119
information, we are under growing

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,737
pressure to deliver content that is

9
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:22,246
precise, structured, and context aware. We

10
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:24,987
are no longer creating content just for

11
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:27,728
human readers. We are creating it for

12
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,469
the systems that help humans find what

13
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:33,210
they need. And that shift puts a

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,168
spotlight on the foundations of

15
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,126
information architecture, the models, the

16
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:39,084
metadata, the relationships that make

17
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:41,159
content understandable to both. People

18
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,794
and machines and to help us

19
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,429
unpack what this means in practice

20
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:49,063
and how teams can build content

21
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:51,698
ecosystems that are ready for intelligent

22
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:54,333
delivery. We are joined today by

23
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,968
Rahel, who has been shaping this

24
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:59,603
conversation for years. So I'm delighted

25
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:02,182
to introduce Rahel Anne Bailie. And

26
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:05,062
those very few people who

27
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,790
don't know her.

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,806
Then there's a quick introduction.

29
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:13,442
Rahel is uh, globally respected

30
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:16,078
expert in content strategy and

31
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:18,714
content operations. She's known for

32
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:21,349
her ability to diagnose complex

33
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,985
ecosystems and build scalable standard

34
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,621
driven operations. She's also the

35
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:29,163
co-author of two influential. Looks

36
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:30,979
content strategy connecting the dots

37
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,157
between business brands and benefits and

38
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:35,699
also the language of content strategy her

39
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:37,877
work has helped organizations around the

40
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:40,419
world treat content as our true business

41
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:43,324
that. So Ryan, thank you so much for

42
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:46,228
joining us thrilled to have you here and

43
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:48,770
happy to be here thank you for.

44
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,746
Fighting me. Great. Uh,

45
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:54,391
so, uh, dear audience, before we dive

46
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,037
in, just a few quick housekeeping notes.

47
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:59,682
I've also pinned them in the chat

48
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:01,950
for you. I'm recording this conversation.

49
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,595
This will be shared on LinkedIn after

50
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:07,241
the event and since we have a

51
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:09,886
lot to cover, so we will open

52
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:12,778
up for Q&A. And your feedback at the

53
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:14,755
end of this conversation. In the

54
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:17,061
meantime, if any question comes to your

55
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:20,027
mind at any point, please drop it in the

56
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,663
chat and I'll gather them and invite you

57
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:25,299
to unmute during the Q&A if you would

58
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,605
like to ask your questions directly to

59
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,571
Ryan and in the due course if you run

60
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:33,168
into any. Critical issues. Feel free to

61
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:35,783
log out and rejoin using the meeting

62
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,772
link, which is also there in the chat.

63
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,640
OK, with that, let's begin.

64
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,113
Let's begin with a look at the

65
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:46,709
challenges that our information

66
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,704
architects and technical writers face

67
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,497
today. So as we move towards AI

68
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,492
driven content delivery, long standing

69
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,088
information architecture challenges come

70
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,482
into sharper focus. Challenges that can

71
00:02:57,482 --> 00:03:00,275
lead even the most sophisticated AI tools

72
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,812
to return results that feel. Irrelevant

73
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:05,070
and misleading, for example, fragmented

74
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,329
content or inconsistent metadata being

75
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,039
the most visible challenge. So right

76
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,749
from your perspective, what are the

77
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,460
challenges like? Which are the hidden

78
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,266
challenges that information architects

79
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,977
need to address for AI powered

80
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:20,880
content delivery?

81
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,237
Well, I would like to to

82
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,883
kind of frame this by saying

83
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:30,530
that it doesn't really matter where

84
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,177
you are working, whether you're in

85
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:35,823
a very small organization or very

86
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:38,470
large organization, a lot of the

87
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,117
challenges are the same because what

88
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:43,965
happens is that. We were told

89
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,754
to use AI and, you know, do

90
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:49,543
do AI, and nobody really starts thinking

91
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:52,332
about the strategic part of what are

92
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,723
we trying to accomplish because there's

93
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:57,512
no single right way to do, you

94
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:00,301
know, to use AI. How you use

95
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:03,090
it is going to depend on what.

96
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,094
Want to do with it. So we have,

97
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:09,029
uh, we all have legacy content and we

98
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,596
started in this business. I've been in

99
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,530
this business for a long, long time. So

100
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,465
the tools that we had at the beginning

101
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,032
didn't really they, they weren't fit for

102
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:22,966
purpose for the way we have to deliver

103
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,842
content today. So everything has kind of

104
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:28,149
grown organically. You know, we started

105
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:30,840
off using word perfect and then it

106
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,532
was, um, word and then it was,

107
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:36,223
um Framemaker and then it was and,

108
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,914
you know, it just kind of grew

109
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:41,605
and grew and grew. And so if

110
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:44,297
we were to take those documents that

111
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:46,996
we were doing. Back then,

112
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,957
because a lot of us are working

113
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,495
on machines or software services or

114
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:55,456
whatever it may be that have existed

115
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:58,416
for many, many, many years. So we

116
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,377
still go back to some of those

117
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:04,338
legacy documents and we we don't have

118
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,155
the kind of robustness. That is

119
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,939
needed, uh, in today's world. So you

120
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,927
mentioned, for example, missing metadata.

121
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,711
Well, that's an obvious one because, you

122
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,096
know, we're using Word perfect or

123
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:19,085
Microsoft Word. You can't componentize

124
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,868
content and you can't put the, the

125
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,652
kind of metadata on it that you

126
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:27,583
want and you combine that. With not

127
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,322
knowing um, who your market is and

128
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:33,062
what the strategy is supposed to be,

129
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:35,802
then how are you supposed to know

130
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,541
how you need to tag it up?

131
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,281
So one of the common things I

132
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:44,020
see is when, um, like the United

133
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,760
States is such a big market, they.

134
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,628
Often start with just domestic product

135
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:51,625
and so you don't have to tag it up with

136
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,023
the country or the language or any of

137
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:56,121
those things because it's one market. And

138
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:58,818
so if you know that you're going to be

139
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,616
expanding into many markets, then you

140
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:02,714
might start tagging it up differently for

141
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,812
those markets. And if you're in things

142
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,610
like, you know automotive, there's a.

143
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,675
Ohh, well known, uh, well well known

144
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:12,430
to people who've been in the industry

145
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,186
as long as me. Um, example of

146
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:16,760
someone who wanted a.

147
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,537
Side mirror or a wing mirror, they would

148
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,985
call it in the UK for the passenger side

149
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,978
of a car and it came and it was the wrong

150
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:28,427
side of the car. Because in the UK they

151
00:06:28,427 --> 00:06:30,876
drive on the other side of the road. So

152
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:33,052
the passengers are on the left and they

153
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:35,229
wanted the the, the, the wing mirror for

154
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,406
the right. So when you have those kinds

155
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:39,713
of things. If you know that you're,

156
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:42,084
you're, you are going to be expanding

157
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,116
into those countries, you start thinking

158
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,825
about those things like, ohh, I need to

159
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,534
be able to tag this up in a

160
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,904
different way. And so we haven't done

161
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:54,275
that. No matter whether you're, you know,

162
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,984
in like as in a small company or

163
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,625
a big company. So it's kind of

164
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,853
a ubiquitous problem because how we

165
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:04,452
deliver content today is so much more

166
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:07,422
complex than how we delivered it even 10

167
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:10,393
years ago or five years ago. And now

168
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:13,363
with AI coming in, it's so important to

169
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:16,334
have all the pieces in place to be

170
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,860
able to deliver the content. The way you

171
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,552
need to. Well, that's very

172
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:24,238
interesting. So I think there is an

173
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:26,925
angle of localization also that you bring

174
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,612
up as one of the challenges. Yeah,

175
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:31,915
yes. And localization can mean multiple

176
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:34,602
languages or it could mean the same

177
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,905
language, but just in different markets.

178
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:39,592
Yeah, certainly. So that's a helpful look

179
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,411
at the. And then just beneath the

180
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,185
surface, right, building on that, I would

181
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:47,958
love to shift focus towards the practical

182
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,732
side of preparing for AI powered content

183
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,317
delivery while addressing these

184
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:54,694
challenges. So tell me, when information

185
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,675
architects and technical writers are

186
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:59,053
planning for this future, what key

187
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:01,430
considerations they should keep in mind?

188
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,705
Well, there are a number of things

189
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08,440
and I think it's important to look

190
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,176
at content holistically and to look at

191
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:13,911
the system holistically. So one of the

192
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,646
things that you might want to think

193
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:19,381
of is how, what are you using?

194
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:22,116
Is it a large language model? Is

195
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:24,719
it a smaller language model?Is

196
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:27,509
it something in house? Are you doing

197
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,900
something using third party agents? You

198
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,691
know, are you using Agenta Ki and

199
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:35,481
and what are where are all these

200
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,271
things coming from? Because we know. So

201
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:41,061
we all know about hallucinations now. We

202
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,851
don't even have to say that at

203
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,081
anymore. Because we're so familiar with

204
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,532
the idea that these large language

205
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:51,334
models can go off the rails, but how

206
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:54,135
do we keep them on the rails? So

207
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,937
do we use a RAG model, for example?

208
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,738
Then what kind of RAG model and is?

209
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,539
How are we doing the prompts and and

210
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:05,417
how are we?What

211
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,952
are we sharing inadvertently with

212
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:10,486
the world as opposed to

213
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:13,021
what are we what do

214
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,555
we need to, you know,

215
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,090
the intellectual property that we

216
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,625
should keep within our organization

217
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,159
and then, you know, when

218
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,019
we're creating the. If you're

219
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,342
familiar with Lance Cummings, Doctor

220
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:31,129
Lance Cummings, he talks about how

221
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:33,452
to structure prompts for technical

222
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:36,239
writing and he will talk about

223
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:39,026
the how you give the AI

224
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,814
a persona like such as you

225
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,601
know you are an expert in

226
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,727
electrical engineering. In this field,

227
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,704
for example, but you also have to give

228
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:52,682
a persona for the audience. And so now

229
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:55,660
it's not enough to just give the one

230
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,638
persona for this end, you need to to

231
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:01,616
give it for the other end. And then

232
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:03,104
you're creating very specific

233
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,593
instructions, but you're also

234
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:07,511
constraining the model. To say like for

235
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:10,155
example, we are only looking at this

236
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:12,799
body of documents, if you think about

237
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,443
this and they call it like the

238
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:18,088
open world versus the closed world model.

239
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:20,732
So the open world model, you say

240
00:10:20,732 --> 00:10:23,376
we want to get insights. However, in

241
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:26,020
our business it's not so much about.

242
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,072
Getting insights for example, like how

243
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:30,384
many customers took things out of their

244
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:32,366
shopping cart before they checked out,

245
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,339
right? I mean, that would be the the kind

246
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,982
of this example of what kind of insights

247
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:40,624
do we see about the market in general.

248
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,606
That's for a different department. We

249
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:45,579
have the the problem of we have a big

250
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,311
body of content. And users want

251
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:51,174
to find that that one thing

252
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:54,037
amongst it's like that needle in

253
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,900
the haystack. And we want to

254
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,763
deliver it on that first try

255
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:02,626
because people are starting to become

256
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:05,489
accustomed to being able to to

257
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:08,250
get that answer. On the first try,

258
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,110
and this is how some organizations

259
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,280
actually set up their metrics, how what

260
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,760
is the successful answer is when they can

261
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,550
get it on the first try and not have

262
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,720
to fiddle around with the keywords or

263
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,890
they don't have to call customer service,

264
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,370
they could just ask and get the answer.

265
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,850
And so how do we make that happen?

266
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,998
On the one hand, we've got this body

267
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:32,706
of content, so it's closed and we want

268
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:35,413
to get an answer out of that. We

269
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:37,783
don't have this big world problem, but

270
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:40,490
what we do have is a content curation

271
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,198
situation. I don't want to call it a

272
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:45,568
problem because I think it's actually an

273
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:48,514
opportunity for us as writers. To to

274
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:51,436
influence how well the content is

275
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:54,358
delivered. So it's not just enough

276
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:57,280
to curate the content, which needs

277
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,201
to be done, but we also

278
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:03,123
have to curate the context. And

279
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:06,045
so when you combine those two

280
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:09,021
things, we become more of. Curators,

281
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,828
then actual writers, because you can get

282
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:14,635
a lot of information that's already been

283
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,442
written in your that you wrote last

284
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:20,248
year or two years ago or five

285
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:23,055
years ago. And now the challenge is

286
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,862
how do I get that pulled out

287
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:28,669
and given to or delivered to the

288
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:30,923
audience?Without delivering them like,

289
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:33,728
you know, the whole essay, the whole PDF

290
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,183
or the whole chapter or the whole

291
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:38,638
section, whatever it may be, they just

292
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,093
want that one piece of information like

293
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,197
at what temperature does this product

294
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:46,002
melt? Well, you would want them to say

295
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:48,107
this product melts at this temperature

296
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:50,799
and and that's it, right?So how

297
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,453
do you get that pulled out? So

298
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:56,108
we're we are now becoming curators as

299
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,384
opposed to, I don't mean just

300
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:01,039
disparagingly, but only if, if we combine

301
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,693
our skill set to only writing, then

302
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,348
we're missing a trick here because now

303
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:09,003
we need to be curators. It's almost

304
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:11,738
like the managing editor. Of a, of

305
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:14,479
a magazine, right? You want to be able

306
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,878
to see what goes in, what complements

307
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:19,619
each other, how people are going to find

308
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:22,018
that information. And one of the other

309
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,731
things is around content maintenance,

310
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:26,473
because I call it The Dirty little secret

311
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,214
of our industry is that it's not so

312
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:31,859
much the cost of the creation. Creation,

313
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,852
content creation costs money. You know,

314
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:37,846
not, um, I'm not downplaying that,

315
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:40,340
but let's say it costs.

316
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,296
£100 to create an article

317
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:46,832
because it takes you that

318
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:49,368
long to do the the

319
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:51,904
drafting, the writing, the getting

320
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:54,439
the sign off and so

321
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,975
on. Now that gets propagated

322
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:59,511
maybe into 12 places and

323
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,230
now you have 13. Copies to

324
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,883
update so when you go to to update it,

325
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:07,832
not only do you still have to do all the

326
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:10,486
same steps, you have to draft you have to

327
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,845
yeah, you have well, first of all you

328
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,203
have to find your original and then you

329
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:17,562
have to draft the update. Then you have

330
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:20,511
to go get it signed off and so on and

331
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,841
so forth so you're not really. Saving

332
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,670
much time there, but now you

333
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,498
have to go find the other

334
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:31,326
12 instances and update them as

335
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:34,154
well. And so this maintenance challenge

336
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,982
is, is compounded with AI if

337
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:39,810
you're not really looking at that

338
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,639
kind of single sourcing and robust

339
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,247
reuse. Strategy so you have to think

340
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,969
about the maintenance challenges and

341
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,347
everybody's maintenance challenges will

342
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,759
be slightly different, but the big thing

343
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,170
now is everyone wants to deliver through

344
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,926
some sort of a natural language query, in

345
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:58,682
other words, a chat bot. So you know,

346
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:01,093
here's the body of content and now

347
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,548
there's going to be this chat. Thought

348
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:06,089
that asks a question you can ask in

349
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,313
natural language and the L will interpret

350
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:10,855
it and it will generate an answer based

351
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:13,078
on the information. And so that brings

352
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,302
its own challenges because it's no longer

353
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:17,844
like, ohh, let's create a PDF or let's

354
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:20,068
create some HTML pages. Now it's hey,

355
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,609
where are those micro facts and how are

356
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:25,225
we going to take?Those and make

357
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,201
them deliverable by an LM in a

358
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:31,177
way that will be useful for the

359
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:34,153
user. So if you have 12 products,

360
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:37,128
uh, let's take a printer. How to

361
00:15:37,128 --> 00:15:39,679
change the printer cartridge? This has

362
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,655
always been one of my bug bears.

363
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:45,100
I'm spatially challenged. So I'm always

364
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,387
looking at the cartridge and going, I

365
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:50,328
don't know how this goes in and I want

366
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:53,268
to look it up now. If I say, how

367
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,555
do I change a printer cartridge, I'm

368
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,842
going to get very generic things like

369
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:00,456
open the cover, uh, take out the old

370
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,743
cartridge, put in the new cartridge. But

371
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:04,737
it's like that's not. Answering the

372
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:06,588
question, the question is which direction

373
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:09,365
is up and which is, you know, what should

374
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:12,141
be facing me and how do I click it

375
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,918
in and so on. So how does it know?

376
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,694
So it has to be tagged with the model

377
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:19,854
number because if it's not the model

378
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,322
number, it won't know which of the 200

379
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:24,790
printers that you make is the right one.

380
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,453
And so they all have different shapes and

381
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,015
sizes of cartridges. And so those are the

382
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:32,578
kinds of things that we think about now

383
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:35,460
is how do I make sure that the delivery

384
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,382
system, whether that's a content delivery

385
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:40,265
platform or a web series of web pages or

386
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,507
a customer support portal or whatever it

387
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:45,070
may be, how do I make sure that?

388
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,863
They can get the right answer. And in

389
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:49,868
some industries, like for a printer

390
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:52,542
cartridge, if I have to ask two or

391
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,881
three times, I will eventually find the

392
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,554
answer and it won't be critical. But if

393
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:00,227
this is a medical device or if this

394
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,232
is something, you know, financial where

395
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:04,906
you could stand to lose a lot of

396
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:07,890
money. If you don't choose the right

397
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,459
option for your investment, you know,

398
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,457
that can be quite life changing for

399
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:16,455
people. And so you know, the the

400
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:19,453
challenge is to get it right and

401
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,450
to get it right the first time.

402
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,020
And and that's not something that.

403
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,429
We're used to having to do

404
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:31,079
before, and so that's creating like

405
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,728
this whole other level of awareness

406
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:36,377
that hasn't been there. Umm, So

407
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:39,027
now all the challenges could compounded

408
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:41,676
basically. Now the technical writers or

409
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,884
information architects have to consider

410
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:46,729
about all possible personas. That might

411
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:49,037
be interacting with a particular system

412
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,729
or content system to get the answers.

413
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,422
And on top of that, they have

414
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,729
to write everything possible that these

415
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:59,422
people might ask, you know, as many

416
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:01,729
things that they can understand and

417
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:04,422
organize it so that AI can deliver

418
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:07,407
content based on that. So that's, yes,

419
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:10,172
it's it, it, it means that we have

420
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,591
to think more carefully about what we're

421
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,010
writing. So I sometimes use that example

422
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,775
of, um, when we used to document like

423
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,540
all the fields, right? So there's a date

424
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,305
field. So you say you enter the date

425
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:25,724
and the date field that tells nobody

426
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:28,686
anything. What it, what would be

427
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:31,410
useful is to say what, uh, what's

428
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,133
uh, the, the format, what date format

429
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,857
do you have to use? Is it

430
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:39,581
day, day, month, month, year, or you

431
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:42,305
know, year, year, year, year, or is

432
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,640
it, uh, year, year, year, year?

433
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,665
Month to month, date, date. And if

434
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:51,360
you're in the system itself, you might

435
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,055
be able to see that you know

436
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:56,750
is grayed out in the the form

437
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,445
field. But if you are looking for

438
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:01,370
something that's more sophisticated than

439
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,065
the date and you need to find

440
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:05,990
that information, how do you?

441
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,348
How is it written so that it's useful

442
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,195
to your user? And that becomes a bigger

443
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,687
challenge because you can't just kind of

444
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,179
sleepwalk through your job. You have to

445
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,671
really be out there thinking how what

446
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:23,518
does the user need? And you know that

447
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:26,010
thing about how we never seem to.

448
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,310
Yeah, um, time with users, right. So you

449
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,874
say, well, well, how many Internet users

450
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:34,438
have you interviewed? Ohh, no, no, we

451
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:37,369
don't get to talk to the users. Well,

452
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:39,567
now it's important to understand what

453
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,497
they need and how they need it so

454
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:45,061
that you can deliver that information. So

455
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,618
I saw a. Uh,

456
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:50,206
a presentation where they were

457
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:52,795
talking about, um, lifts, elevators

458
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,383
and so to, um, to

459
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:57,972
do elevator repair, they would

460
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:00,560
have the directions, but they

461
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,148
found that it was easier

462
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:05,737
to teach how to do

463
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,517
the elevator repairs. By building

464
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:11,409
a plywood elevator safely on

465
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:14,302
the ground and having AR

466
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:17,194
glasses or VR glasses, AR

467
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:20,086
glasses and having them go

468
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,400
into this environment and.

469
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,296
Do it as if they're working on it and

470
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,206
then the instructions would show in the

471
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:30,116
glasses. Well, how are you taking that

472
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:32,026
into account if you don't know that

473
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,390
that's how they're using it?

474
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,850
Right. So those are those are things that

475
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,190
we have to think about now that we didn't

476
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,010
really have to think about before. So

477
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,090
it's really making us wonder kind of what

478
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,690
are we doing and why are we doing it and

479
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,030
how are we doing it so that it's useful

480
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,850
because at some point what we're doing

481
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,150
may not be useful anymore.

482
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,424
So now it becomes important we understand

483
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:58,137
our users, the content users, what they

484
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,851
need and how the content is being

485
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:03,564
delivered. So all these things we have

486
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:06,278
to factor in when we write, hey,

487
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,991
you know, even put pen to paper

488
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,705
or whatever type anything. So we have

489
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,318
to consider. All these things beforehand

490
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:17,307
and plan them. So, yeah, so that's

491
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:20,296
a great tool for laying out all

492
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:21,150
those constraints.

493
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,223
So it's began preparing for AI powered

494
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:28,806
delivery. It is about building the right

495
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:31,019
foundation so that content can actually

496
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,864
move through the intelligence systems

497
00:21:32,864 --> 00:21:34,709
that now organizations are putting

498
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,292
together so that the content is accurate

499
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:40,128
and consistent. Now

500
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:43,071
when teams start putting together

501
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:46,014
these systems, what do you

502
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,956
see as essential building blocks

503
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:51,899
or an information architecture that

504
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:54,841
truly supports AI driven content

505
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,557
delivery?So

506
00:21:57,557 --> 00:22:00,392
we are talking about building

507
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:03,226
blocks. Yes. One of the

508
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:06,061
things that that's been happening

509
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:08,896
recently is that we started

510
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,731
an association called Kinetic Kinetic

511
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,565
Council and I coined the

512
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:17,400
the term kinetic information because.

513
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,351
Penises, the definition of kinesis

514
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:22,972
is that that there's an

515
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:25,593
outside force you have. You

516
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:28,214
have something that's innate and

517
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,835
or static, and then an

518
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:33,456
outside force comes and it

519
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:36,077
there's movement in response to

520
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:38,739
this external stimulus. And when

521
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:41,397
you think about a, um, content in

522
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:43,674
an AI context, that's exactly what

523
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:46,332
happens. We create all the content and

524
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,989
we keep it in a repository somewhere,

525
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:51,647
whether that's in a CMS or a

526
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:54,304
CDP or within our CCMS, wherever we,

527
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:56,961
we hold it and then an AI

528
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,886
and an LM or. The CMS

529
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:02,426
or something comes and calls that content

530
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,966
and then that content gets delivered for

531
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,869
a user to one or more users. And

532
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,771
so when we think about content, now we

533
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:13,311
have to think about the, you know,

534
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:15,851
kinetic, kinetic content. So we have to

535
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:18,391
think about content as having Kinesis and

536
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:21,378
to do that. We can't think of

537
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:24,069
just an authoring system. So some people

538
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,760
will say, well, you know, I put

539
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,451
my content into a CCMS and now

540
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,757
it's componentized and I've got metadata

541
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:34,448
on it. I'm done. And you can't

542
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:37,139
really think about it that way. You

543
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:39,830
have to think about an authoring system.

544
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,573
So ideally a CMS or something

545
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:45,217
similar, something that lets you put

546
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,860
lots of semantic metadata on it

547
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,503
and then you think about the

548
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:53,147
semantics. So semantics are, you know,

549
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:55,790
a knowledge graph of some sort.

550
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,350
The red graph seems to be.

551
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,971
The thing to use at least right now, so

552
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:05,515
you have a a knowledge graph that will

553
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:07,740
create all the relationships for you. And

554
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,648
then and when you think about

555
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,556
relationships, you think, think of like

556
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:14,417
how a mind map works, right? You have all

557
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:16,643
these concepts that connect to each other

558
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:19,186
and then they connect to other things and

559
00:24:19,186 --> 00:24:21,774
so on. So. The, the, UM,

560
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:24,747
the knowledge graph is kind of that

561
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:27,720
same. It operates that same way. It's

562
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,693
not just a taxonomy, It's not just,

563
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:32,391
um, hierarchical is forming

564
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:35,364
relationships. And to do that is great,

565
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:38,337
but then you have to constrain it

566
00:24:38,337 --> 00:24:41,310
as well. So that's where the rag.

567
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,560
Comes in. So all of all of this

568
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,159
is part of the orchestration layer. So

569
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,758
the orchestration of the content is like

570
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:52,358
once it's written and once you've added

571
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:55,328
metadata, then it goes into kind of into

572
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:58,298
the oven and gets baked with, you know,

573
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:01,269
with the help of the knowledge graph and

574
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:04,005
and. And you know the rag model

575
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,919
that helps with the delivery and then you

576
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:09,833
get to the delivery end. The delivery end

577
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,382
could be so many different things. Now

578
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:15,296
it's it's yes, you could still have a

579
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:18,210
PDF, you could have HTML, you could have.

580
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,309
AR, VR content delivery platforms marked

581
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:26,247
down like there's so many ways that

582
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:29,186
it could be delivered. So you have

583
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:32,124
to think of this in the holistic

584
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:35,063
sense of a content ecosystem and not

585
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:37,581
just like a tool, because whatever

586
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:40,549
whichever tool you pick, it's only. Part

587
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:43,512
of the puzzle and so you have to think

588
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:46,475
about it in the the bigger sense and in

589
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:48,450
particularly when you get into multiple.

590
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,420
The languages and multiple markets,

591
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,320
because that becomes quite complex.

592
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,112
Umm, you have to factor in machine

593
00:25:58,112 --> 00:26:00,106
translation, etcetera. So, but there's

594
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:02,897
one thing I've, uh, that comes to

595
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:05,689
my mind. We had, we have had

596
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,480
so many complex CMS CMS systems so

597
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,272
far and what I see the content

598
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:14,064
delivery when it happens via a digital

599
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:16,535
assistant or say. GPT or

600
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:19,272
uh, cloud, uh, third party

601
00:26:19,272 --> 00:26:22,010
agents or an organization's own

602
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,747
digital assistant, they read the

603
00:26:24,747 --> 00:26:27,485
information from flat files and

604
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,222
in knowledge graphs, right? Which

605
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,960
are basically specially designed a

606
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,797
particular format of information. In

607
00:26:35,797 --> 00:26:38,083
the relationships and information are

608
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:41,046
defined. Work in that

609
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:43,908
scenario is the use of the complex

610
00:26:43,908 --> 00:26:46,770
content hierarchies that we had in our

611
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,632
legacy content and the CMS that we

612
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:52,494
had, you know, the various containers and

613
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,538
folders and directory systems and

614
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:57,400
whatnot. So what happens to that? So.

615
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,480
So, um.

616
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,022
I'll answer this question in

617
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,664
kind of 2 levels. So

618
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:09,306
the first thing is we

619
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:11,948
can still can I, can

620
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:14,591
I use unstructured content? Yes,

621
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,233
it can. Will it give

622
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,875
you highly accurate answers? No,

623
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:22,673
the more structure. To add

624
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:25,530
to the content, the better.

625
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,407
AI can use it and part

626
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:33,264
of it is because it understands

627
00:27:33,264 --> 00:27:36,121
the context. So if you are

628
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,978
going to ask, I've got a

629
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:41,835
few examples but one that just

630
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:44,692
comes to mind is at one

631
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:47,668
point I was. Asking and and

632
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,532
this is this isn't even AI, this

633
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:53,397
is just with Google search. I was

634
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:56,262
asking about wine bars and so they

635
00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:59,127
showed me all of the the establishments

636
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:01,991
in my neighborhood that I could go

637
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:04,856
to meet friends to drink wine, but

638
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:07,721
I wanted to buy a piece of

639
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:10,599
furniture. So when you're looking

640
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:13,558
at wine bars, you have the schema for

641
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,516
venue because venue is, uh, you know, in

642
00:28:16,516 --> 00:28:19,105
schema.org venue is, you know, wine bar

643
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:22,063
could be a venue, but as soon as

644
00:28:22,063 --> 00:28:25,022
I say I want to buy a wine

645
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:27,611
bar, then they know, they understand the

646
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:30,508
context is that by. Equals product equals

647
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,125
show furniture and you'll get a

648
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,305
completely different set of search

649
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:37,922
results. Now when you take that

650
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:40,538
and you amplify it so they

651
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:43,155
say garbage in garbage out and

652
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,771
so it's like garbage in is

653
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:48,388
amplified garbage out for AI and

654
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:50,991
what we. You don't want is

655
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:53,845
is that amplification of poor content. So

656
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:56,700
if you have a little bit of

657
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,146
structure, like in Microsoft Word using

658
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:02,000
the style sheets, you've got a little

659
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,855
bit of a structure, but it doesn't

660
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:07,709
tell you enough to be useful. So

661
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:10,612
an example would be. Uh, and this

662
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:13,232
came from a vendor who was showing us

663
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,524
their software. If you have, um, a

664
00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:17,815
document like a Word document that was

665
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:20,762
saved as a PDF and you have in there

666
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:23,709
heading 1 heading to, but by the time you

667
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:26,001
get to heading through, you're just using

668
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:28,620
italics. So you get like, what is the

669
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,449
dosage of this medication?So here's about

670
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:34,326
the medication. Here's the dosage. And

671
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:37,203
then it goes like for adults,

672
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:40,080
for teenagers, for children, for infants.

673
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,957
So you've got four different doses

674
00:29:42,957 --> 00:29:45,834
for four different audiences. And if

675
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:48,711
you're just using a, you know,

676
00:29:48,711 --> 00:29:51,428
a PDF. The the the LM

677
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:53,540
might pick up the wrong one.

678
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,470
Because it won't know

679
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,450
from the structure.

680
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,682
There's not enough structure to inform it

681
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:06,621
accurately, so it might pick up the right

682
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:09,560
one and it might not pick up the

683
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,500
right one depending on how it was written

684
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,704
editorially. Now if you have more

685
00:30:14,704 --> 00:30:17,643
structure, then it's going to be able to

686
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:20,583
pick up the right one because the the

687
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,777
metadata. On it and the knowledge graph

688
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:25,119
will have said that this is about this

689
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:27,169
product and it's about this dosage and

690
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:29,511
it's for this audience and it might even

691
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:32,146
go as far as it's in this market because

692
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:34,196
in this country we don't sell that

693
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:36,245
product. In this country we sell that

694
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:38,588
product and in this this other country we

695
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,637
sell the product but under a different

696
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:43,419
name. And so it can tell all

697
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:45,588
those relationships and it can deliver

698
00:30:45,588 --> 00:30:48,481
the right thing to the right person. So

699
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:51,373
the the more structure you have, the more

700
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,904
context the AI understands and the more

701
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:55,350
accurately it can deliver.

702
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,749
The results and there is

703
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:02,528
you know the IRS, which

704
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,307
is a delivery schema especially

705
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:07,531
meant for technical documentation.

706
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:10,310
They've run different tests on

707
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,089
it and it's it once

708
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:15,868
if you have highly structured

709
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:18,581
content plus. A knowledge graph

710
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:21,082
plus the using IDs, you

711
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:23,583
get very very high quality

712
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,084
results consistently. You know, even

713
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,586
when you run the test

714
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,587
2030405060 times you're getting

715
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:33,088
consistently high quality results, but

716
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,589
without that if you are

717
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:37,590
only using the LM.

718
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,019
And you didn't have the knowledge graph

719
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,989
and the the semantic layer and and so

720
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:46,959
on. And you're just running it on Word

721
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:49,558
docs or PDFs. It's somewhere around 25%

722
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:52,157
compared to 85%. So that's a huge

723
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:54,825
difference, right?The

724
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:57,375
structure means, uh, difference here. So

725
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:00,350
what our legacy content, if it was

726
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,325
well structured, will serve us well. Uh,

727
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:06,300
so we, yes, definitely. And when I

728
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,850
say structure, I'm not meaning editorial

729
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,550
conventions like, you know.

730
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,243
But the most important paragraph at

731
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:18,015
the right after the H1? That's

732
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:20,326
an editorial convention. I'm talking

733
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:23,098
about the semantics where you actually

734
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:25,871
add the metadata on to make

735
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:28,643
it very explicit to the machines

736
00:32:28,643 --> 00:32:30,954
to understand what that particular

737
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:33,430
sentence or paragraph. This section is

738
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,383
about. Umm, so that's

739
00:32:36,383 --> 00:32:39,310
great insight. Thanks for breaking that

740
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,237
down, Ryan. And once these foundational

741
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:45,164
building blocks of, you know, semantics,

742
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:48,091
orchestration, delivery, they are all in

743
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,018
place. The next challenge is figuring

744
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:53,944
out how teams can actually work

745
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:56,510
with them. Day-to-day. So, looking

746
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,110
at the practical side of

747
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,190
implementation, what day-to-day practices

748
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,270
should information architects and

749
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,870
technical writers should follow so

750
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,470
as they prepare for a

751
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,030
given content delivery?

752
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,277
I think that it, it, there is no

753
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:16,995
kind of 1 formula. Everything is going to

754
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,033
be different depending on what you're

755
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:21,750
trying to achieve. So the first thing you

756
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,467
have to do is focus on what you're

757
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,845
trying to achieve, what is the business

758
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,883
goal? And then you determine which

759
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,921
practices are right for your organization

760
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:33,652
and then. What is right for your

761
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:36,287
team? So you need to kind of

762
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:38,922
work backwards from that and you you

763
00:33:38,922 --> 00:33:41,557
need to use a fit for purpose

764
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:44,192
tools. So if if your company is

765
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,450
expecting you to do miracles with

766
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,085
Microsoft Word, it's not going to happen.

767
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:51,720
It just won't happen. And so you.

768
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,780
Want to have some sort of a tool, a

769
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,760
production grade authoring tool. This is

770
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,750
what I'm um.

771
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,713
You know, we use the term CMS, but

772
00:34:02,713 --> 00:34:04,898
outside of our industry, nobody ever

773
00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:07,446
understands what that is. But really you

774
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:10,359
want an authoring tool that is, um, you

775
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:13,272
know, they want you to, to run a

776
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:15,457
content production line. Well, then you

777
00:34:15,457 --> 00:34:18,370
need a production line tool, right? So I.

778
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,252
And sometimes use the donut factory as an

779
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:24,014
example. It's like you can make Donuts in

780
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:26,085
your home kitchen using the little

781
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:28,847
silicon mold where you can do 6 at

782
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:31,609
a time, but that's not going to help

783
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:34,026
you supply an entire bakery. If you're

784
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:36,788
doing the bakery, you need, you know, the

785
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:39,205
big dough mixer and the big extruder

786
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:42,173
that. Spits out 24 doughnuts at a

787
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:45,097
time and puts them on an assembly line

788
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:48,022
to go into the fryer. And so to,

789
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:50,946
to get that, um, that kind of operational

790
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:53,870
efficiency, you need to be able to, um.

791
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,930
Tag up your contents and so on. It's not

792
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,054
enough to take the content and then throw

793
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:02,444
it over the wall with the big long e-mail

794
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:04,303
and expect somebody else to read your

795
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,162
mind about which content goes with which

796
00:35:06,162 --> 00:35:08,551
audience and so on. You need to be able

797
00:35:08,551 --> 00:35:10,676
to do it because you know why you're

798
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,800
writing it, right? So as you're writing a

799
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,393
particular sentence, it's like, ohh, I

800
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:17,212
better tag that. Happens with, you know,

801
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:19,932
um. Monaco only or whatever

802
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:22,005
he'll, uh, Luxembourg only. So when

803
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:24,769
you're creating this, you have to kind of

804
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:27,188
work backwards. And we're used to doing

805
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:29,952
that in, in content where they need this

806
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:32,371
delivered at this time. And how many

807
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:35,135
weeks do we need to be able to

808
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,899
do, you know, to, to have to do

809
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:40,313
these things?And we work backwards all

810
00:35:40,313 --> 00:35:42,607
the time for scheduling. So we also need

811
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,900
to work backwards when it comes to, you

812
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,193
know, what our practices are to be able

813
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:50,060
to say OK and to be able to do to

814
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,927
get this result, we need to be able to do

815
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:55,793
this. And to do that, we need to be able

816
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:58,373
to do that. To do that, I need these

817
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,596
tools. To be able to accomplish all of

818
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:03,519
this. Hmm ohh but didn't grant

819
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,170
too much.

820
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,058
Alright, I do understand that

821
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:11,786
because we are looking at,

822
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:14,513
uh, wide spectrum of, uh,

823
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:17,241
you know, uh, availability of

824
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,969
tools. They are large organizations

825
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,697
that provide their employees with

826
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:25,424
in-house AI, digital agents, alms

827
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:27,305
and. Cortana playgrounds, dedicated

828
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:29,397
playgrounds to test their prompts,

829
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:32,326
etcetera. And on the other hand, there

830
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:35,254
are startups that don't have that kind

831
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:38,183
of, you know, uh, situation. They have

832
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:40,850
resource scarcity. So

833
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,430
we are looking at both ends

834
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,010
of spectrum here where people have

835
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,590
a lot, but still they, uh,

836
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,740
struggle with fragmented content and

837
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,320
spread across, you know, content league

838
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,900
of sorts where a lot of

839
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,480
different pieces of contents are there,

840
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,380
video, audio, text, whatnot. And on the

841
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,886
other hand, there could be a startup that

842
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:06,079
is just, you know, putting together their

843
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,959
operations for this first time, telling

844
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,152
their technical writers, all you have is

845
00:37:10,152 --> 00:37:12,658
GitHub knock you hours get it Then we

846
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:15,477
will give you add the most one ChatGPT or

847
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:17,670
rather sorry, open AI license. That's it.

848
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,177
That's what you are getting. So it can

849
00:37:20,177 --> 00:37:23,134
be. A little bit of a difficult

850
00:37:23,134 --> 00:37:25,679
situation for technical writers in either

851
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,223
situation to understand what their makes

852
00:37:28,223 --> 00:37:31,192
use of in their current setup, so

853
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:34,011
I think. We have to

854
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:36,466
spell it out. If you can give both

855
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:38,614
situations some kind of, you know, best

856
00:37:38,614 --> 00:37:41,376
practice 1 where there is a lot but very

857
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:43,524
little guidance and the other place where

858
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:45,672
they are starting from the scratch and

859
00:37:45,672 --> 00:37:47,820
they have the ability to build something

860
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,275
from the ground but they don't have many

861
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:52,423
resources. If you could give some kind

862
00:37:52,423 --> 00:37:55,260
of. Price for that? Well,

863
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,031
um. So

864
00:37:58,031 --> 00:38:00,908
first of all, the field is moving

865
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:03,785
very fast. So every few months there's

866
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:05,840
something new, something new and

867
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,717
something new. So even what I tell

868
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:11,594
you today might be outdated next week.

869
00:38:11,594 --> 00:38:14,060
But, um, if you're just starting.

870
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,180
Or you are a very small team or

871
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,900
a team of 1. Then you could you

872
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,600
could do something like um.

873
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,832
You could use

874
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:28,380
markdown and.

875
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,907
It's not going to be perfect, but

876
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:37,724
it's better than nothing. So you could

877
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:40,541
use Markdown and GitHub. You could also

878
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:43,358
get an A license to Oxygen and

879
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,176
use GitHub. And they've made this kind

880
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:48,993
of like a a very modest CMS

881
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,841
for single person. So, you

882
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:54,453
know, you could you, you could

883
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:57,065
do it that way and then,

884
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:59,678
um, you may not have a

885
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:02,290
knowledge graph, but you can certainly.

886
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,320
Um.

887
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,255
Use whatever information architecture and

888
00:39:10,255 --> 00:39:12,876
taxonomy tools that you have, even

889
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:15,498
if it's an Excel spreadsheet. You

890
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:18,119
can make your taxonomy in the

891
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,741
Excel spreadsheet and use those. I

892
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:22,925
guess it's like consistent tagging,

893
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:25,110
right? So that's what's important.

894
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,503
And it, you know, you, you

895
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:31,417
start with that when you're a

896
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:34,330
bigger team then you will, you

897
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,244
might even have in-house created systems,

898
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:40,157
right? Because there will be other

899
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:43,071
departments working on other projects and

900
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:45,984
there might be things that you

901
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,713
can. Um, kind of tag

902
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:51,523
onto their license or, uh, reuse

903
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:54,333
some of the, the work that

904
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,143
they've done and it won't all

905
00:39:57,143 --> 00:39:59,953
fit, but sometimes you can, you

906
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:02,763
know, get kick started that way

907
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:05,573
there you probably will have things

908
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:08,191
like a. The CMS and,

909
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:11,157
uh, the AI and the CMS is

910
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:14,122
going to be for kind of editorial

911
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:17,088
quality. It won't give you much more

912
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:20,054
than that. You'll have some sort of

913
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:23,020
a knowledge graph or some sort of

914
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,985
semantic tool and then you may use

915
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:28,607
a content delivery platform. You

916
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:31,229
know, such as like a fluid

917
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,850
topics or, um, uh, there are

918
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,472
a few others that are kind

919
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:39,094
of attached to a CMS and,

920
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:41,716
um, that will, that will alleviate

921
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:44,337
your burden a little bit because

922
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,959
the things that you used to

923
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:49,544
have to do. Manually in

924
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:52,255
in knowledge graph software or

925
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:54,966
in taxonomy software. Now the

926
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:57,677
LM and in the the

927
00:40:57,677 --> 00:41:00,388
delivery platform will take some

928
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:03,098
of that burden on. So

929
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:05,809
it's it works very differently

930
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:08,520
so I think for me.

931
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,489
It's it's the idea that you have to

932
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:14,348
kind of keep up with what's going on

933
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:15,420
in the marketplace.

934
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,345
You know, just stay informed because

935
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:21,1000
there might not be something for you

936
00:41:21,1000 --> 00:41:24,655
today, but there could be something for

937
00:41:24,655 --> 00:41:27,309
you 3 months from now, but you

938
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:29,964
won't find out about it unless you

939
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:32,618
are keeping your ear to the ground.

940
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:35,273
Yeah, so they can listen to your

941
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,982
podcast as well as. Meet your

942
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:40,962
LinkedIn post about this to learn more

943
00:41:40,962 --> 00:41:43,814
about that uh. Now

944
00:41:43,814 --> 00:41:46,658
data does lend itself well into

945
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:49,503
this particular ecosystem, you know, it

946
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:52,347
does provides a structure and it

947
00:41:52,347 --> 00:41:55,191
allows us to include metadata also.

948
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,035
But there's one thing I mentioned

949
00:41:58,035 --> 00:42:00,880
this before. Finally, what actually is

950
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,775
fed into the digital assistance. Or

951
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:06,503
chat, GPD or whatever that is

952
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:09,232
flat printed so they make sense

953
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:11,961
of information that is in text

954
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:14,689
form. So how do we, you

955
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:17,418
know, cross that bridge that we

956
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:20,147
have content written in detail, very

957
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:22,875
well tagged and also annotated for

958
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:25,466
you?Single source for different

959
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:27,724
audiences, different locale, uh, sorry,

960
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:30,434
locales, yeah, uh, you know, for

961
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:33,143
global audience. And then we are

962
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:35,853
required to generate something in text.

963
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,562
So that is a do you

964
00:42:38,562 --> 00:42:41,272
think there is still a need

965
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:44,043
for data in this scenario?Now,

966
00:42:44,043 --> 00:42:46,651
can we find something else that could

967
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:49,632
supplant data, uh, when it comes to, you

968
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:52,240
know, the well structured content? Uh, is

969
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,104
there another format, another rival

970
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,085
format or anything else that could do the

971
00:42:57,085 --> 00:42:59,752
job well?Asked

972
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:02,707
for AI and right now it's

973
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:05,661
the best that's you know, it

974
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:08,616
performs better than any anything else.

975
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:11,570
Um, markdown is the second best.

976
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,737
And the reason the second best is because

977
00:43:15,737 --> 00:43:17,090
a lot of um.

978
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,491
A lot of the technology

979
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:24,122
for delivering content it has

980
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:26,753
like native markdown, but markdown

981
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:29,384
has its limitations. And so

982
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:32,015
how do you compensate for

983
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:34,646
those limitations? Well, you know,

984
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:37,278
so it really is, is

985
00:43:37,278 --> 00:43:39,915
is is. The and the

986
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:42,604
reason that that it is the

987
00:43:42,604 --> 00:43:45,293
best is because the markdown is,

988
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:47,983
uh, sorry, the markup is richer.

989
00:43:47,983 --> 00:43:50,672
So what you're writing is really

990
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,361
important now. So if you say

991
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:56,051
it, I'll use the noun instead

992
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:58,740
of it, right? So if it's.

993
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,759
The the P2240, call it the

994
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:04,647
P2240 all the time. Don't say

995
00:44:04,647 --> 00:44:07,404
it because. The AI,

996
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:10,359
the LM, is going to be reading

997
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:13,313
the text. Now you could say it

998
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:16,268
everywhere and then you would have to

999
00:44:16,268 --> 00:44:19,222
put the metadata in for P2240 because

1000
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:22,177
that distinguishes it from the P2241 and

1001
00:44:22,177 --> 00:44:25,132
the P2242 and the P42243. Or you

1002
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:27,584
could just do it. In

1003
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:30,281
the text itself, so

1004
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,979
it's not as important

1005
00:44:32,979 --> 00:44:35,676
anymore to have um,

1006
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:38,443
uh. For example,

1007
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:41,429
an entire topic. Yeah, I mean, topics

1008
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,415
are still good because when you need

1009
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,401
to read the entire topic, it's there.

1010
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:50,388
But if you just need that one

1011
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,947
piece of information, then the one

1012
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:55,080
sentence can do the trick.

1013
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,980
But if the sentence is poorly

1014
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,810
written, then it's not going to

1015
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:04,640
be useful for the LM, right?

1016
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,470
So it's it. This is where

1017
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,300
it all comes together. And and

1018
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,130
as I said, can the LM

1019
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,960
use unstructured content? Yes, it can.

1020
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,153
But it doesn't give you good results.

1021
00:45:19,153 --> 00:45:21,936
So the best results are still with

1022
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:24,720
with dinner because dinner was built for

1023
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,310
that kind of, um.

1024
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,406
That kind of delivery before its time it

1025
00:45:30,406 --> 00:45:32,942
was built for that kind of delivery if

1026
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,478
you used it or well, because there are

1027
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:38,013
more than one way to use data and

1028
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:39,598
sometimes people aren't putting the

1029
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:41,817
tagging in and they aren't doing the

1030
00:45:41,817 --> 00:45:43,719
information architecture in a way that's

1031
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:46,572
going to be useful. So this goes back to

1032
00:45:46,572 --> 00:45:49,430
what are the goals. That you're

1033
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,318
trying like the business goals, then what

1034
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:53,476
are the objectives? And then what is, you

1035
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:55,365
know, what are your practices and what

1036
00:45:55,365 --> 00:45:57,793
tools are you using? And so you have to

1037
00:45:57,793 --> 00:45:59,681
start there to know whether you're doing

1038
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:01,300
it right up at the beginning.

1039
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,837
Right. So structured content and use of

1040
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:08,683
data is a couple of takeaways that

1041
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,530
I can understand from this. Uh, apart

1042
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,970
from that, uh, looking across everything

1043
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,410
well that we discussed the challenges,

1044
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,037
foundations and day-to-day practices,

1045
00:46:18,037 --> 00:46:20,883
what are the key takeaways that you

1046
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:23,730
would want the people who are attending?

1047
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,557
Right, though, uh, to carry with them as

1048
00:46:26,557 --> 00:46:28,625
they prepare for a different content

1049
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:31,382
delivery key take away. So I, I think

1050
00:46:31,382 --> 00:46:34,140
we kind of touched on them already. So

1051
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,897
one is to start with, what is the

1052
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:39,309
return on investment that you wanna get

1053
00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:42,067
that your business wants to get? Like is

1054
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:44,914
their goal to reduce support?Is

1055
00:46:44,914 --> 00:46:47,519
their goal to have self-service? Is

1056
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,123
their goal to have 100% accurate

1057
00:46:50,123 --> 00:46:51,860
delivery? And then, uh.

1058
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,340
Work backwards from there to figure out

1059
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,107
what you want to do and how you

1060
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,490
need to do it.

1061
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,489
No, that's the the first one

1062
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:06,139
and the second one. Is that

1063
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:08,788
because the second aspect is that

1064
00:47:08,788 --> 00:47:11,438
because the the field is progressing

1065
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:14,087
so quickly, just keep learning. Yeah,

1066
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:16,737
there are a number of people

1067
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:19,694
talking about. How they

1068
00:47:19,694 --> 00:47:22,378
use AI and how they're experimenting

1069
00:47:22,378 --> 00:47:25,061
with it and, um, you know,

1070
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:27,744
learn from them. I, I published

1071
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,427
recently a series of people to

1072
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:33,111
follow who talk about AI and

1073
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:35,794
LinkedIn, and I think there were

1074
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:38,646
12 or 13 of them. And

1075
00:47:38,646 --> 00:47:41,574
so those are some folks to start with,

1076
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:43,770
um, and semantics folks, there's, um.

1077
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,807
Uh, Jessica Talisman and a few others I,

1078
00:47:47,807 --> 00:47:50,088
I can't remember, uh, Larry Swanson. You

1079
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:52,369
could always share the names later. You

1080
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,650
can always share the names later. Yeah.

1081
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,583
So, you know, just learn from them so it

1082
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,864
doesn't happen. When I say learn, it

1083
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:02,797
doesn't mean ohh, I have to sign up for

1084
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,404
a course and take a course and spend

1085
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:07,476
every. Uh, weeknight doing this sometimes

1086
00:48:07,476 --> 00:48:09,513
it's just in five minute increments here

1087
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:11,551
and there. Yeah. You know, Michael Leon

1088
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:14,171
Tosca is a great one to, to follow on

1089
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:16,500
LinkedIn. So you just read one of his

1090
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,829
posts and that's it for, you know, the

1091
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,158
day or for the week. And now you've

1092
00:48:21,158 --> 00:48:23,196
learned a little something and it will

1093
00:48:23,196 --> 00:48:24,360
give you that that.

1094
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,444
That lead is like being a detective and

1095
00:48:29,444 --> 00:48:31,879
finding these clues to, you know, what do

1096
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:34,617
I want to do? How can I do this

1097
00:48:34,617 --> 00:48:37,051
better? How can I make it easier for

1098
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:39,181
myself? How can I meet those business

1099
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:41,616
goals? So you have to just keep keep

1100
00:48:41,616 --> 00:48:44,475
sleuthing. Probably make

1101
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:47,417
use of something like Notebook LM AI to

1102
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:49,992
figure out this information for you and

1103
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:52,934
give you the gist of it. So that's

1104
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:55,140
a great way to do that.

1105
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,270
That is great for that.

1106
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,950
So thank you so much for

1107
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:05,611
all these insights and that gives

1108
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:08,271
our listeners a solid view of

1109
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:10,932
both the strategic and practical size

1110
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:13,592
of preparing AI driven content delivery.

1111
00:49:13,592 --> 00:49:16,253
And now I'm going to open

1112
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,913
the floor for Q&A and let's

1113
00:49:18,913 --> 00:49:21,764
hear questions. For our audiences, have

1114
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:24,576
any so, uh, their audience, I

1115
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:27,387
am unmuting you. You go ahead

1116
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:30,199
and ask your questions and you

1117
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:33,010
can also put those in chat.

1118
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,496
I just want to say your session was so

1119
00:49:42,496 --> 00:49:44,154
good, that's why we didn't have

1120
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:46,860
questions. Oh, oh,

1121
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,730
thank you.

1122
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,421
Ohh, they could add some

1123
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:54,630
value, yeah. Hi everybody.

1124
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,804
Just was wondering, uh, in all this talk

1125
00:49:58,804 --> 00:50:01,549
that is there a trade off between making

1126
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:04,293
our content more readable for AI? Does it

1127
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,695
become less, uh, less consumable by human

1128
00:50:06,695 --> 00:50:09,439
beings? Like I mean, the example that you

1129
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:12,183
gave where you don't write it right? So

1130
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:14,928
you, you kind of putting the name again.

1131
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:17,667
So it seemed like. The natural way for

1132
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:20,241
humans to read it, yeah, just for one

1133
00:50:20,241 --> 00:50:22,493
thing. What are your thoughts? Like, I

1134
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:25,389
mean, does it have to be, uh, two ways?

1135
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,963
Like, I mean, better for AI, better for

1136
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:30,858
humans, or is it going to be better for

1137
00:50:30,858 --> 00:50:33,679
both?It's a, that's

1138
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:36,458
an excellent question actually. And, and,

1139
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:39,236
um, I'm glad you're giving me

1140
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,015
the opportunity to cover it. So

1141
00:50:42,015 --> 00:50:44,794
let's think about it this way.

1142
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:47,572
Is that the consumer is the

1143
00:50:47,572 --> 00:50:50,351
third line of, of consumption because

1144
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:53,195
first it's, um. The the

1145
00:50:53,195 --> 00:50:55,874
LM or the AI that's consuming your

1146
00:50:55,874 --> 00:50:58,552
content and then it's through the search

1147
00:50:58,552 --> 00:51:01,231
engine or the delivery portal and then

1148
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:03,909
it's from the person. So if it's

1149
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:06,588
not a machine readable, it's never going

1150
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:09,266
to make it to the person because

1151
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,945
there will be somebody's stuff who's more

1152
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:14,230
machine readable. Than yours if you're

1153
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,110
looking at it from that like a search

1154
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,630
engine perspective. If it's, if it's a

1155
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,790
self-contained, that's a bit of a

1156
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,310
different story. I would counter that the

1157
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:24,670
UM.

1158
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,590
The principles of like plain language

1159
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,170
and and modularity and so on,

1160
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,320
where everything is kind of

1161
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,470
self-contained. I don't think that

1162
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,050
dropping it and using like the

1163
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,630
proper noun is actually making it

1164
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,210
less readable for a person. I

1165
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,790
think it's actually making it more

1166
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,310
readable. For a person, because

1167
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,310
they've shown that, uh.

1168
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,043
People in today's world don't really

1169
00:51:55,043 --> 00:51:57,745
understand how modifiers work. So when

1170
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:00,448
you say it, they don't know

1171
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:03,151
what it's modifying. So it's and

1172
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:05,854
particularly if you have someone for

1173
00:52:05,854 --> 00:52:08,556
whom English is the second or

1174
00:52:08,556 --> 00:52:11,259
third language, and this goes for,

1175
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:14,143
you know. In any language, when

1176
00:52:14,143 --> 00:52:16,816
you stop to think about it,

1177
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:19,490
um, when you stop to think

1178
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,719
about language, um, you're, you're

1179
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:24,376
really, um. Looking

1180
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:27,009
at clearer for the end user, but

1181
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:29,642
it's also making it clearer for the

1182
00:52:29,642 --> 00:52:32,275
intermediary steps, which is the AI and

1183
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:33,780
then the search engine.

1184
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,710
Or the chat bot.

1185
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,266
And boy is adding to what trial as

1186
00:52:41,266 --> 00:52:43,773
saying we are already seeing this change

1187
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:46,281
in behavior of human behavior. They don't

1188
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:49,146
want to go to a help hotel or

1189
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:52,012
search for it. They would rather pick up

1190
00:52:52,012 --> 00:52:54,520
their phone probably and ask a question

1191
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,385
to say Gemini or perplexity or if they

1192
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:59,737
have their companies. Own chat boards,

1193
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:02,554
they would ask the question directly in

1194
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,372
natural language. In that case, the way

1195
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:08,189
the content was written, if it says

1196
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:11,006
P22 instead of eight, it doesn't matter

1197
00:53:11,006 --> 00:53:13,823
to the human reader also because they

1198
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,640
are consuming it the same way, you

1199
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,613
know, through the machine. So that is

1200
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,116
a marked behavior change and because of

1201
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,977
it, I don't think the content in the

1202
00:53:24,977 --> 00:53:27,838
back, you know, under the hood and the

1203
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:29,984
content that is being delivered, there's

1204
00:53:29,984 --> 00:53:32,487
a slight difference. What do you say

1205
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:33,560
right about that?

1206
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,857
What is delivered is more attuned to the

1207
00:53:37,857 --> 00:53:40,773
audience. Well, what is delivered

1208
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:43,013
is, you know, generative. So it's

1209
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:45,626
generated and it's depending on. So like,

1210
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:48,612
you know, not all elements are good at

1211
00:53:48,612 --> 00:53:51,598
the same thing. And so, um, some LM's

1212
00:53:51,598 --> 00:53:54,584
will be better at kind of analysis and

1213
00:53:54,584 --> 00:53:57,570
others will be better at the kind of,

1214
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,273
you know, ohh. Editorial aspects.

1215
00:54:00,273 --> 00:54:02,979
So when you're thinking about,

1216
00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:05,686
um, content, really just think

1217
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:08,393
about the user, but also

1218
00:54:08,393 --> 00:54:11,100
follow the the principles like

1219
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,806
plain language principles and natural

1220
00:54:13,806 --> 00:54:16,513
language processing principles and so

1221
00:54:16,513 --> 00:54:19,220
on to to think about.

1222
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:22,199
How to make it clear? So going back

1223
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,968
to like, you know how we have the

1224
00:54:24,968 --> 00:54:27,738
dosage right? So if you have I I

1225
00:54:27,738 --> 00:54:30,507
want to know the dosage for an infant,

1226
00:54:30,507 --> 00:54:33,276
it's going to be very clear. If you

1227
00:54:33,276 --> 00:54:36,045
say the dosage for an infant is instead

1228
00:54:36,045 --> 00:54:39,031
of saying you know. The

1229
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:41,766
dosage is right because the dosage is

1230
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:44,502
1 teaspoon maybe 3 paragraphs before you

1231
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:47,237
said, you know, here the, the, the,

1232
00:54:47,237 --> 00:54:49,973
the, the, the categories. And now you

1233
00:54:49,973 --> 00:54:52,708
say the dosage is this the. And

1234
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,444
so if you're reading the whole thing,

1235
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:58,179
it'll be easy for you to understand

1236
00:54:58,179 --> 00:55:01,038
that. You mentioned the audiences in

1237
00:55:01,038 --> 00:55:03,416
this order and now you're talking about

1238
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:06,133
it in this order, but the machine won't

1239
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:08,511
understand that, and because of that, it

1240
00:55:08,511 --> 00:55:11,228
might get delivered to the user the wrong

1241
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:13,946
way. So if you are very, very clear

1242
00:55:13,946 --> 00:55:16,323
and you're thinking about clarity for the

1243
00:55:16,323 --> 00:55:18,361
machine, then you're also thinking about

1244
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:21,217
clarity for the user. That almost

1245
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,725
as a proxy. You're using a machine as a

1246
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:26,233
proxy for the user. I don't know if that

1247
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:29,208
makes sense. Right, I think,

1248
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,950
I think it all depends on um, you

1249
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,691
know, how correct is the answer given by

1250
00:55:34,691 --> 00:55:37,433
the machine. So I'm sure that if the

1251
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:39,489
answer is precise, people will definitely

1252
00:55:39,489 --> 00:55:40,860
prefer to do that.

1253
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,871
Instead of, you know, actually going

1254
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:47,276
through the docs. So yeah, makes sense.

1255
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:50,025
But yeah, I, I mean, like maybe it

1256
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:52,430
was a bad example. Uh, some examples

1257
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:55,179
could be like maybe you could put more

1258
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:57,927
images for humans, but maybe I would not

1259
00:55:57,927 --> 00:55:59,989
understand that very well. Or perhaps

1260
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,400
tables, you know, maybe I gets. Confused

1261
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,640
with tables that gets thrown off. I don't

1262
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,760
know that that's true.

1263
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,029
So, you know, and now this comes back

1264
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:12,400
to what I said earlier about rethinking

1265
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,109
the way we do content, because if you

1266
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:17,818
think about like, what is the, what is

1267
00:56:17,818 --> 00:56:20,188
the purpose of all text? Well, the

1268
00:56:20,188 --> 00:56:22,898
purpose of all text is to describe what's

1269
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:25,607
going on in an image. So yeah, if

1270
00:56:25,607 --> 00:56:27,300
you think about different learners.

1271
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,694
Different learning styles. Yeah, image is

1272
00:56:29,694 --> 00:56:32,346
great, but you could also include the

1273
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:34,999
alt text that makes it readable or

1274
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:37,273
you know, you're describing the image

1275
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:39,926
that makes it readable for the machine

1276
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:42,578
so it can deliver things to the

1277
00:56:42,578 --> 00:56:45,231
the consumer and I don't know enough

1278
00:56:45,231 --> 00:56:45,610
about.

1279
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,602
Like reading the captions of images and

1280
00:56:50,602 --> 00:56:53,314
all the different LM's and so on

1281
00:56:53,314 --> 00:56:56,025
and so forth. So I don't want

1282
00:56:56,025 --> 00:56:58,350
to mislead you, but it's worth

1283
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,674
experimenting with those things so that

1284
00:57:00,674 --> 00:57:03,386
you know which LM is better for

1285
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,710
your particular use case. Because let's

1286
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,490
say you're doing API. Documentation for

1287
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,290
developers, well, that's a very

1288
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:14,090
different use case than, um,

1289
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:15,770
delivering, um, um.

1290
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,074
Medical information to the average

1291
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:22,658
person, right? So you, you, you

1292
00:57:22,658 --> 00:57:25,242
want to say, OK, well, when

1293
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,826
I'm doing this API documentation, uh,

1294
00:57:27,826 --> 00:57:30,411
what are the questions that the

1295
00:57:30,411 --> 00:57:32,995
developers are going to ask so

1296
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:35,579
that I can have that information,

1297
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:38,550
um. You know, kind of go through the

1298
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,168
LM and go through the the search engine

1299
00:57:41,168 --> 00:57:43,459
to them or however it's being delivered

1300
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:46,076
to them. And that's kind of what, you

1301
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:48,040
know, when you're thinking about content

1302
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,676
curation and then context curation,

1303
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,966
that's what we're talking about is making

1304
00:57:51,966 --> 00:57:54,584
sure that it's going to work for the

1305
00:57:54,584 --> 00:57:57,278
person at the other end. And it's

1306
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:59,860
got to work for all the intermediaries

1307
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,811
before it can get to that person. But

1308
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:05,763
it should be good for both. It shouldn't

1309
00:58:05,763 --> 00:58:08,714
favor the machines over the users, but it

1310
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:11,296
should be equally good for both purposes.

1311
00:58:11,296 --> 00:58:13,510
That's a very good insight, so.

1312
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:17,237
We are about to wrap up this

1313
00:58:17,237 --> 00:58:19,643
conversation now and thank you everyone

1314
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:22,049
for your thoughtful questions. And a

1315
00:58:22,049 --> 00:58:24,856
special thank you to Ryan for sharing

1316
00:58:24,856 --> 00:58:27,664
such value with insights with us today.

1317
00:58:27,664 --> 00:58:30,471
It has been rich and in Azure

1318
00:58:30,471 --> 00:58:32,877
using conversation. So folks, it's time

1319
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:35,772
to wrap up. I hope to

1320
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:38,718
welcome you back in the coming year

1321
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:41,243
for more conversations as the space

1322
00:58:41,243 --> 00:58:44,189
continues to evolve. And one more thing,

1323
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:47,135
do watch out for follow up post

1324
00:58:47,135 --> 00:58:50,081
to this conversation. And I'm going to

1325
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:53,027
bother right to share all the names

1326
00:58:53,027 --> 00:58:55,749
that she had forgotten. Right now, but

1327
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:58,595
I'm sure she will share all the names of

1328
00:58:58,595 --> 00:59:01,442
the people she wants us to watch out for

1329
00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:03,972
and follow. And also I need tools that

1330
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:06,502
she herself make use of to say add

1331
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,400
metadata or create knowledge graphs and

1332
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,297
whatnot. So her tool recommendations and

1333
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,511
people recommendations are going to be in

1334
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,460
that follow up.

1335
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,753
So I guess until then,

1336
00:59:17,753 --> 00:59:20,526
bye bye to you all

1337
00:59:20,526 --> 00:59:22,190
and happy 2026.

1338
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,474
Bye, bye. Thanks for for having me.

1339
00:59:27,474 --> 00:59:29,860
Bye. Thank you. Thank you everyone.
