00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:12,869
Hello everyone, and welcome to

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,577
today's session. I'm your host and

4
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:18,286
deep learning AI ambassador. Joining

5
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,994
me today is Scott Abel, also

6
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:23,702
known as the Content Wrangler, A

7
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:25,507
globally recognized content strategist

8
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:27,764
and thought leader in technical

9
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:29,570
communication through his insightful

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,283
blog and engaging webinars, he

11
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,195
has empowered the technical writing

12
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:36,107
community with practical strategies and

13
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:37,637
forward-looking ideas. Welcome Scott.

14
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,314
It's a pleasure to have you with

15
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:42,991
us today. Thank you for having me.

16
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,521
I appreciate the invitation.

17
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:47,821
Well, let's begin. Today we are diving

18
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:50,359
into a critical topic, how documentations

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,321
success metrics are evolving in the age

20
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:55,859
of AI. With automation and intelligence

21
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,398
systems reshaping the workflows, how do

22
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:00,936
we measure impact and success in

23
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,651
documentation? Scott, we

24
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:06,355
are now seeing a wide spectrum

25
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,608
of AI enablement and documentation

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,861
workflow from AI assisted content

27
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,566
surfacing to fully AI generated help.

28
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:15,819
Alongside that, user personas and

29
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:17,622
delivery mechanisms have evolved

30
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:20,326
dramatically. In this new landscape, is

31
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:22,579
the definition of success shifting?

32
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,476
From your perspective, what does the

33
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:27,439
documentation success look like today?

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,023
I think success is still

35
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:34,527
similar. In other words, we

36
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,030
still want to deliver the

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,534
most engaging, relevant, helpful content

38
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:42,038
that we can to our

39
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,542
audience. But I would say

40
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:47,045
if content can't be parsed

41
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:49,984
by machine, mapped or trusted. By

42
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,534
some kind of large language model or

43
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:55,085
maybe an agentic system, It's going to

44
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,1000
fail no matter how well written it is,

45
00:01:57,1000 --> 00:02:00,914
no matter what our intent is. So maybe

46
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,101
success means the content behind your

47
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:04,922
product is structured, it's governed,

48
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:07,109
it's enriched with enough that metadata

49
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,659
that AI tools can retrieve it. Reason.

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,605
Over it and then deliver correct answers.

51
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,451
I think there was some research

52
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,297
by MIT in 2025. They found that

53
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:21,142
most enterprise AI pilots fail due to

54
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,988
poor underlying data and content, not the

55
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:26,834
AI itself. And by the way, it

56
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,680
should be noted that that same research

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,552
said that 95%. Of current agentic AI

58
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,271
projects are failures and it's because of

59
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,989
the lack of what I just said,

60
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,318
no structured content, no governance, no

61
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,648
metadata that's designed to empower the

62
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:44,978
machine to deliver the experience. No

63
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:47,696
longer are we in charge of delivering

64
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:50,026
the experience, we're in charge of

65
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:51,579
helping the machine to.

66
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,624
Umm. So

67
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:58,043
in this scenario, do

68
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,462
you really think that,

69
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:02,881
uh, AI will actually

70
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,301
AI enabled content will

71
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,720
actually, uh, uh, deliver

72
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,929
successful content?

73
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,337
That would be useful to customers. It

74
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:15,735
depends on your definition of success. So

75
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,790
content can't assume a single reader

76
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,530
anymore. It must work for our end users

77
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,271
that we imagine in our head right there,

78
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,669
the prospects and the customers we serve.

79
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,066
It also has to work for support

80
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,122
engineers, people who are trying to

81
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,930
provide support services. She doesn't

82
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,774
users, it has to work for API consumers.

83
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:37,263
If you're a software company and there

84
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:39,752
are so many companies that have a

85
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,529
software division to support their

86
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:43,662
efforts that almost every company has

87
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:46,151
some kind of connection to API consumers.

88
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,929
So software developers and product

89
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:50,062
product developers will need help and

90
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,382
they now are an audience. Onboarding

91
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:54,795
agents, so agents that are bringing

92
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:57,612
traffic to your content are also now

93
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,428
one of your readers. And so I

94
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:03,244
think it's important for us to think

95
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:06,060
about success with content as the same

96
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,876
source of content has to perform across

97
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:11,692
the web. Help, embedded UI guidance, chat

98
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:13,878
bots, developer portals. Agent based

99
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,635
assistance without fragmentation or

100
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:18,271
without reauthorizing. And so success is

101
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,907
going to be multi channel and

102
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:23,543
multi persona, but it also needs

103
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:26,179
to be measurable not aesthetic. So

104
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,815
we have to shift from the

105
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:31,451
is the documentation clear to does

106
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:34,051
the documentation reduce. Correction. So

107
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:36,681
maybe success would be lower

108
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:39,310
support ticket volume, shorter time

109
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,940
to resolution, higher task completion

110
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,570
rates, accurate answers from AI

111
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,199
systems on the first try.

112
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,989
Reduced content debt is a big one. Faster

113
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,103
onboarding of writers and subject matter

114
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:55,218
experts and content updates that are

115
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:57,685
measured in hours instead of weeks. I

116
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:00,152
think those are some of the success

117
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:02,620
metrics that are changing and that our

118
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,439
focus needs to kind of be shifted toward.

119
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,554
Scott, the the success metrics that you

120
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:13,399
are talking about, a lot of them

121
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,837
seem to be the traditional success

122
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:18,682
metrics. So do you mean to say

123
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,714
that those metrics remain relevant

124
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:23,152
irrespective of AI enablement or without

125
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:25,997
it? Yeah. And if you think about

126
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:28,794
it in an intellectual way. Your job

127
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,411
is to communicate the value of what you

128
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:34,029
do first to your employer in order for

129
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,973
them to support you in the way that you

130
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:39,264
need to be supported, right, with the

131
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:40,900
right tools and technologies and

132
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,535
standards and specifications to deliver

133
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:44,826
the value that the company wants. That

134
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:47,116
doesn't change, right the the fact that

135
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,492
we need to serve multiple audiences. Is

136
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:52,158
the change right? And the audience is now

137
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:54,490
include machines. And that's a big deal

138
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,822
because machines do not operate in the

139
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:59,154
way that humans believe they do. Human

140
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:01,486
belief is often a little Askew from

141
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,152
reality, but our metrics still have to be

142
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:06,151
the same. So, for example, writers

143
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:08,150
shouldn't be judged on writing, they

144
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,792
should be judged. On their ability

145
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:13,412
to model knowledge, govern terminology,

146
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:16,033
maintain content systems, let's see

147
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,129
established workflow for continuous

148
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,749
delivery, make the content reusable,

149
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:23,370
repurpose table traceable and testable

150
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,990
so documentation becomes more of

151
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,611
a discipline, a data discipline

152
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,526
and success. Means embracing that shift

153
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:34,177
and, and kind of building systems

154
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:36,828
and processes and procedures that are

155
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:39,478
durable that would allow for the

156
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,129
next generation of writers to come

157
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,780
into our world and produce content

158
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,430
with their knowledge, right? They might

159
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,101
be raised on AI systems. Just

160
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,427
like our generation may have been raised

161
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:54,420
with mobile phones, so we our

162
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,748
anticipation and expectations are

163
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,409
slightly different than everyone else's.

164
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:01,301
Umm, that's a great insight squirt.

165
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,022
Uh, so uh, given, uh, these

166
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:06,743
changing success metrics, there are still

167
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:09,465
new success metrics and if we

168
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:12,186
could build upon that and spell

169
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:14,907
out specific metrics that are more

170
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:17,629
relevant now with AI, if you

171
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,515
could spell out. If two or three

172
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,426
of them, I can do a couple. Let's,

173
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:26,336
let's, let's tackle like 5 of them really

174
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,883
quickly. The first one is page views

175
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:31,067
measure traffic. They do not measure

176
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,250
effectiveness. So we need metrics that

177
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,797
can help us determine whether our effort

178
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:37,980
was effective. So page views indicate

179
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,799
things like demand or discoverability.

180
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:42,583
Now here's what they don't tell you.

181
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,892
Whether the content actually solved the

182
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:47,201
user's problem, Whether the content was

183
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,125
correct. Whether the structure supported

184
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,433
AI reuse. Whether it actually helped

185
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,127
reduce any kind of costs. So a

186
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,821
high traffic page may simply mean the

187
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:59,514
product is confusing and lots of people

188
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:02,268
land. There, that's the first one. The

189
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:04,949
second one is page level ranking is

190
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,631
less meaningful in an AI world because

191
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:10,312
search engines are no longer the primary

192
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:12,611
access point for many users. Increasingly

193
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:15,292
the answers come from some in product

194
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,974
guide, a chat bot and an embedded

195
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:20,358
assistant, maybe an LM powered. Help

196
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:23,216
Portal, even AI agents that never view

197
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:26,074
a page at all will be consuming

198
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:28,932
that content and so how do we

199
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:31,790
rank that as a page level ranking?

200
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,648
So I think ranking stills value, but

201
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,689
mostly for external discoverability, not

202
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:38,731
for measuring let's say documentation

203
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:41,490
quality. What do all these

204
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,661
metrics, you know what, what, what these

205
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:45,832
metrics do still offer are they they

206
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:47,693
remain useful as signal indicators. For

207
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,174
example, if you had a sudden spike in

208
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:52,655
Page views, that might reveal a surge in

209
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:55,137
user confusion. I mean, you won't know it

210
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:57,618
it, it could be confusion, It could be

211
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:59,789
the delight, right? But there's some kind

212
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,717
of spike. And we're trying to ask

213
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:05,378
the metrics to signal indications that

214
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,040
are useful to us. For example,

215
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,701
a drop in search traffic might

216
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:13,362
suggest that SEO problems or maybe

217
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,580
some outdated content topic level

218
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,241
analytics could help us uncover our

219
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,957
usability issues in the product. Itself,

220
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:23,949
but these are not secondary. These are

221
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:26,086
secondary metrics, right? They're not

222
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:28,651
primary measures of success. The metrics

223
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,643
that really matter now are let's take

224
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:34,635
a look at a few of these.

225
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:37,200
I would say first contact resolution

226
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,192
accuracy. So how accurate is the first

227
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,563
time?That somebody interacts with the

228
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:44,812
chat system, how accurate is the

229
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:47,436
resolution that we've given them? If we

230
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:50,060
do it right, we will have accomplished

231
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,559
support ticket deflection, right

232
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,183
attributable bulk to a specific piece of

233
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:56,806
content that provided a resolution. If we

234
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,055
score our content for healthfulness, so

235
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,929
let's say healthfulness might equal.

236
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:03,659
Completeness, consistency, reuse, that

237
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:06,422
kind of thing. Those scores

238
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:09,184
may give us metrics that

239
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:11,394
matter. Terminology accuracy across

240
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:14,157
systems. Is the terminology accurate

241
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,367
and consistent across different

242
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,129
variations of our content? So

243
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:22,103
if we provide terminology. On a

244
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:24,799
health portal, is it the same that the

245
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,158
support people are using? Are they the

246
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,854
same words? Do they mean the same thing?

247
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:32,213
Are we talking about the same things?

248
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:34,572
Task completion rates, both human and AI?

249
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:37,268
And so we have to know, did a

250
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:39,627
bot that visited our site complete the

251
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:42,550
task they were sent to complete?Uh, and

252
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,152
we're humans able to do the same thing

253
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,104
when humans encountered our content. And

254
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,032
then maybe one of them, that's kind of a

255
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,635
new way to think about it is parse

256
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,587
ability. How often does an LLM

257
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,539
misinterpret or misuse your content and

258
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,816
deliver something that is not what you

259
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:01,744
would want it to deliver? So we want to

260
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,421
know. How parsable is our content by

261
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,704
the machine to deliver the correct

262
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:09,366
responses? And then maybe the last thing

263
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:12,029
is a common metric we already use,

264
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,311
but reuse ratios in structured content

265
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:16,593
environments. How often? How many times

266
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,875
is a piece of content repurposed

267
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,538
identically from a single source? And if

268
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:24,236
you paid to produce?At once, but

269
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:27,159
you reused it 83 times and then you

270
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,352
translated that content into 16 languages

271
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,545
and again reused each of those

272
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:33,006
translation translations 80 sometimes.

273
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:35,930
What is the reuse ratio? What kind of

274
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,854
value are we getting for? What return do

275
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:41,777
we get for that investment in the reuse

276
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:42,220
strategy? Those

277
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:45,046
uh, now that we have

278
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:47,769
identified some, uh, new documentation

279
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:48,658
success metrics,

280
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,869
the next step is about

281
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:54,047
implementing them thoughtfully and

282
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,770
measure their impact. If you

283
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,493
could, uh, build upon that

284
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:02,488
and where. When and how should technical

285
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,667
writers measure the success metrics to

286
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,208
get meaningful insights? Umm, this is a

287
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,750
tricky question because there is no one

288
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,292
place to insert somebody because of the

289
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,470
answer that consultants often give to

290
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,649
almost every question. Which is It

291
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:19,191
depends. It depends on how mature your

292
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:21,369
organization is. It depends if you

293
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:24,198
actually. Do what you say you do. It

294
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:26,594
depends if your style guide is actually

295
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:29,332
not just a document that exists on the

296
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,728
land. But if the style guide is

297
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:34,124
interactive and it enforces the rules, I

298
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,520
think then we begin to mature our

299
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,573
discipline to where we become more

300
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:39,942
content choreographers and content.

301
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:43,421
Orchestrators as opposed to the content

302
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:46,087
creators, maybe we rely on the machine to

303
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:49,085
help us. And so the point at which we

304
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:51,417
need to intervene and change things, I

305
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,416
think is way up at the front. We need

306
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,415
different skills. I am confident that

307
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:58,747
most technical writers who are not being

308
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:01,079
educated about AI and I'm not talking

309
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,857
about. How to write a prompt and make

310
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:06,559
it spit out some words? I'm talking about

311
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,924
how to use AI to operationalize every

312
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,951
step in our content production factory

313
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:13,653
when we understand and we do each of

314
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:16,355
the things that needs to occur, and we

315
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,720
also understand the order in which those

316
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,085
things should ideally occur in an ideal

317
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:24,041
world. Right, which we do not always live

318
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,942
in, but a machine can help us to.

319
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:30,571
Isolate each of those tasks, weave them

320
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:32,363
together using our boolean logic

321
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:34,872
knowledge, right? If this, then that, and

322
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:37,738
we map it all out. That's going to

323
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:40,247
be the job of the technical communicator,

324
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,756
and if we insert ourselves there, we

325
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,417
become less. Similar to

326
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,560
the machine, management may see the

327
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,060
machine as it generates words, The people

328
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,561
generate words. Why do we need the

329
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:55,061
people, right? And that's not the thing,

330
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,919
right? The people are the reason that the

331
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,776
words exist, and we need to build systems

332
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:03,276
that will help us deliver the content

333
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,220
that we need to deliver. Do

334
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,908
it better, more efficiently, faster,

335
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,596
higher quality, more consistently than

336
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:11,960
humans could do alone because of our

337
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,323
flaws as not being machines, right? I

338
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:17,024
don't know that's really a flaw, but it's

339
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,050
a difference, right? It's a difference

340
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,413
between humans and machines if the humans

341
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,777
will sometimes forget to follow the rule

342
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:25,802
or decide they don't want to.

343
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,019
Right. For whatever reason, but the

344
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:30,936
machine will follow our instructions. So

345
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,812
I really feel like our job is to insert

346
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:35,729
ourselves as orchestrators and to develop

347
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:37,965
the capability to master these things and

348
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:40,521
to develop, I want to say, AI literacy.

349
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:43,077
We do not have strong AI literacy. I

350
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:45,633
listen to a lot of technical writers talk

351
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:48,487
about. Um, the magic of a

352
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,280
AI. And I think that it's easy

353
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,073
for me, even as a human, to

354
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:56,866
be sucked into the magical powers that

355
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,686
seem to be. Associated

356
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:02,354
with AI, and this is a danger for

357
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,688
technical writers. We need to be the

358
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:07,022
naysayers who say we're not naysaying the

359
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,689
technology, we're naysaying the reliant

360
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:10,690
reliance on it without building the

361
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,357
proper infrastructure in place, the

362
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,024
proper governance and workflow, the

363
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:16,025
proper boundaries that prevent the AI

364
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:17,692
from doing things like hallucinating.

365
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:22,219
Uh, uh, what I get

366
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,756
from this is that we

367
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:27,293
need 2 levels of, you

368
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,830
know, measuring of success. One

369
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,367
is internally where technical writer

370
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:34,903
herself is, you know, checking

371
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:37,440
whether the content generation and

372
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,737
publishing is happening. Correctly. And

373
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:42,515
at the other end after delivery to check

374
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:44,252
the effectiveness of the documentation

375
00:15:44,252 --> 00:15:46,683
that is already delivered. Uh, is that

376
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:49,461
what I'm getting? Uh, am I getting this

377
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:52,239
right? Yeah, I think so. And you know

378
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:55,018
I'm guessing just as much as the the

379
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:57,796
other people are. I think what we have

380
00:15:57,796 --> 00:16:00,546
to rely on is that. There were other

381
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:02,748
major changes in the past that many

382
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:04,950
people in our industry thought would kill

383
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,522
our industry or that would.

384
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:10,409
Make it less likely that we would be able

385
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,592
to enjoy the careers that we have today.

386
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:15,049
But as it turns out, it just was an

387
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,959
opportunity to learn new things and to

388
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,143
try things in a different way. And there

389
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:21,326
are still people, I am certain that there

390
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:23,510
is somebody on a typewriter or or word

391
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,874
processor somewhere still cranking out

392
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:26,512
pages of documentation for some product.

393
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:28,422
But the discipline itself as it matured.

394
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:31,294
And it looked for new ways to engage

395
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,745
the people who participate in it. We

396
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:36,546
developed a new ways of doing things that

397
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,297
were better, faster, cheaper, stronger.

398
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,748
And not everybody uses them, but the

399
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,200
people who do are more marketable. They

400
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,001
are able to deliver more. They can segue

401
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,452
to other careers a little bit faster

402
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:50,861
sometimes. If they want to jump out of

403
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:51,997
technical documentation into another

404
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:53,701
area, because our experiences are so

405
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:55,973
important, they not only get us close to

406
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,961
the product and an understanding of the

407
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:59,950
user and the people involved in the

408
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,654
process of creating and delivering the

409
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,642
value, but we become the arbiters of

410
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:05,630
what's important and what's not, even if

411
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,902
we don't put it in the documentation by

412
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,902
not putting it in there. They are

413
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:11,652
deciding what is and what is not

414
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:14,364
relevant. Yeah,

415
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:17,022
that's great. Uh, so, uh.

416
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:21,082
Now for the most important question,

417
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,722
how do we map the documentation

418
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:25,922
success metrics to broader organization

419
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:28,562
goals and how we can visually

420
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:31,202
demonstrate those metrics as a clear

421
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:33,402
drivers of business impact when

422
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:34,722
presenting to leadership?

423
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:39,171
OK, this is a big one to unpack

424
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:41,375
because just to be clear, technical

425
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,314
writers usually are not good at this. In

426
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,886
my experience, we are better at words

427
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:49,090
than we are with numbers, and

428
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,661
unfortunately This Is Us using words to

429
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:53,866
explain numbers. Often we explain the

430
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,389
things that we think intellectually. They

431
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,022
should want to know about, but oftentimes

432
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:01,656
leadership does not care about many of

433
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:04,289
the things that we want to tell

434
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:06,923
them about, which is why numbers are

435
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:09,557
necessary, which is why we need to

436
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:12,190
measure those in some way, which shows

437
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,824
a clear graphs and numbers and, uh,

438
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:17,139
you know, visual. The representation of

439
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,849
this documentation success actually, uh,

440
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,901
resulting in product success or service

441
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,637
success for that matter. And what I found

442
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,373
is that when we only use that as

443
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,084
our presentation delivery mechanism, what

444
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:30,820
we end up with is a PowerPoint deck

445
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,556
with a bunch of stuff that no one

446
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:35,608
cares about. Here's what leaders already

447
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,870
care about. They already care about stuff

448
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,169
they say they care about. We should be

449
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,181
mapping every one of our requests to

450
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,906
things they already care about. They

451
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:46,205
already care about how much it costs to

452
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:48,217
pay support people. They already care. If

453
00:18:48,217 --> 00:18:50,516
you want to convince them to care about

454
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:51,666
structured content because that's

455
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,678
important to you, that's a stupid thing

456
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:55,978
to focus on because it can be important

457
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:58,196
to you. It can be the most important

458
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,974
thing to you, but the most important

459
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:02,260
thing to the leader will be how do we

460
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,038
reduce the amount of money that we're

461
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:06,070
spending on the support center? How do we

462
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,102
increase the amount of time that you know

463
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:09,626
that we spend working on research

464
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,658
projects that help us get ahead of the

465
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:13,182
competition, right? How do we deflect

466
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:15,214
those support calls so that we can use

467
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:16,992
that money for another project that we.

468
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,729
Wish we had money to fund. They already

469
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:22,275
care and are thinking about that. So I

470
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:25,139
think we have to map all of our efforts

471
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,367
at producing metrics that help us explain

472
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,595
the stories that they already care about.

473
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:31,822
You know, I guess I would say.

474
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,172
Reducing operational cost is an obvious

475
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:38,012
one. However, I will tell you that a

476
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,497
CEO I recently interviewed told me that

477
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,982
when he had negotiations with the board

478
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,822
of directors about the future of his job,

479
00:19:45,822 --> 00:19:48,662
they asked that CEO if he could deliver

480
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:51,502
8% on increases on sales. They did not

481
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:54,305
ask him to save any money. I just

482
00:19:54,305 --> 00:19:56,097
speak. Let's just be clear, there was

483
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:58,146
nothing in his contract that asked him to

484
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:00,451
save money. I came to the table saying I

485
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,500
can help you save money, he said. That's

486
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,292
nice. Can you help me make 8%?

487
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,541
Ohh, I can help you save 2% over there.

488
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,913
That's the same thing. No, it's not the

489
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:13,582
same thing. An 8% increase in sales is an

490
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:16,250
8% increase in sales. I want you to help

491
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,623
me with that. So if you wouldn't have

492
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:20,995
been so forward and told us, we wouldn't

493
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:23,070
have been able to go back and

494
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,553
retroactively repackage our our value

495
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:26,955
proposition to match. What he already was

496
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:29,480
responsible for and even though he told

497
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,366
us, I realized that if I give you

498
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:34,891
$100,000, let's just say it was 100,000

499
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:37,777
and you saved me 500,000, that is an

500
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:40,662
amazing thing. But if I give you the

501
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:43,548
100,000 and you do not save me the

502
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:45,712
500,000 or your product gets delayed.

503
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:48,833
Then I don't meet the 8% goal that I

504
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,820
promise to deliver to the leadership.

505
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,800
When they go to evaluate me, the CEO of

506
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,118
the company or the president of the

507
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:58,767
company, they will say I failed to make

508
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:01,748
my 8% commitment and they will ask me why

509
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:04,397
I spent $100,000 on a project that had

510
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,242
nothing to do with that. So

511
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:09,877
we have to shift our thinking right to

512
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,853
like leadership thinking. The other thing

513
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,829
is they care about increased customer

514
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,476
satisfaction. They care about the

515
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:17,122
customer retention because the retention

516
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:19,099
of the customer means that their

517
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:21,404
subscription fees or the price they pay

518
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:23,710
for our product right will continue to

519
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,674
flow into the company and end up on the

520
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:29,666
balance sheet. And the last thing

521
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,340
is accelerating product adoption and time

522
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,015
to value. When people, especially in

523
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:37,244
software environments, report why they

524
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:39,918
churned or they no longer want

525
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:42,593
to be your customer, it is

526
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,268
often because they cannot find the

527
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:47,942
value in your product and then.

528
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:50,789
That gets blamed on, ohh, well, we didn't

529
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,218
have good documentation or there was poor

530
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:55,994
support, or the product was designed in a

531
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:58,423
cumbersome way to begin with. But it

532
00:21:58,423 --> 00:22:01,199
could be our job to help them minimize

533
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:03,975
churn. And if that that helps them keep

534
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:06,751
their sales figures up, they'll see it as

535
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:09,626
a good value. Yeah, that's

536
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:12,055
a really good way to map documentation

537
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:13,789
success metrics to organization goes.

538
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:15,871
Yeah, that's right. One more example,

539
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:18,646
because I feel like I I leave this

540
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:21,074
hanging in a generic way. Many people

541
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,809
that are interviewed on technical

542
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,890
documentation shows will use these words.

543
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,666
You can do whatever it is, XY and

544
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,364
Z. We pick whatever you want and

545
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,968
you will get ticket deflection. That may

546
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:35,571
not be true and here's why. Ticket

547
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:38,175
collection is about the number of tickets

548
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:41,150
that come in compared to a private a

549
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,753
previous number and a smaller number. You

550
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:46,357
assume that the bigger number, now you

551
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:48,589
have a smaller number, therefore you've

552
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:50,837
deflected tickets. But what happens if

553
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,505
you deflect a bunch of tickets, but you

554
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,506
also simultaneously in a different part

555
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:58,175
of the company, release a new product and

556
00:22:58,175 --> 00:23:00,176
it attracts brand new people? They've

557
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:01,844
never experienced your content. They

558
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:03,845
don't understand where how you organize

559
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:06,180
things on your website. So they call

560
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,848
support and the tickets go up, but the

561
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:11,241
tickets are going up. They're going down

562
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,979
for existing products, they're going up

563
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:15,006
for new products because the new people

564
00:23:15,006 --> 00:23:17,322
are brand new to your company. So they

565
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:19,639
may be confused, they don't know what to

566
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,377
do. They need confidence. They call

567
00:23:21,377 --> 00:23:23,404
support. So the support tickets need to

568
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:25,431
be categorized in a way that are

569
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:27,458
meaningful. It just can't be the total

570
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,195
volume of support tickets, which then

571
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:30,933
begs the question, does the support

572
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:33,052
department?Have the ability to measure

573
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:35,164
the granularity of those call purposes,

574
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,627
the reasons for those calls and from

575
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:40,091
whom, and present it back to the

576
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:42,202
technical documentation team in a way

577
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:45,018
that we can make better content to help

578
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:47,481
them deflect the the ones that are

579
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:49,593
deflectable for example, if you're just

580
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:52,242
brand new today and you. Really are on

581
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:54,109
deadline and you get a new software

582
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,242
product and you need to finish a project

583
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:58,642
on Friday and it's Tuesday and you have a

584
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,509
problem. You may call support, you may

585
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,176
not want to you you may want to find the

586
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,576
answer on your own. But you think, ohh, I

587
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:07,442
only have three days to finish my

588
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:09,576
project, I need to call support that gets

589
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:12,298
counted as a ticket. All right,

590
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:15,257
but it's not really a ticket that

591
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:18,216
was due to a deficiency in the

592
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:21,175
documentation in so much as it might

593
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:24,134
have been a confidence call. The human

594
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:27,093
beings that we are trying to educate

595
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:30,052
and inform and guide, they're also there.

596
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,742
They could be psychologically.

597
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:34,030
Manipulated, right? We give them joy, we

598
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,922
help them protect from scare, being

599
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:38,130
scared or confused or frustrated. So we

600
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,338
kind of have to use our psychology

601
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:42,230
knowledge and how we communicate to

602
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,753
leadership too. You know, we need to tell

603
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:46,961
them that we'll help you reduce operating

604
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:49,169
costs. Maybe we could do some ticket

605
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:51,376
deflection. We can attribute some of our

606
00:24:51,376 --> 00:24:54,046
efforts to that. Maybe we could do first

607
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:56,277
contact resolution. We can get it up

608
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:58,827
faster. So if they have to call, they

609
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:01,377
only have to call once instead of three

610
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,609
times. Maybe we can reduce the content

611
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:06,477
depth that we have in our in our in

612
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:08,390
our teams and maybe more importantly,

613
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,302
something they can visualize. Maybe we

614
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,534
could update the velocity of the content

615
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:14,856
production. Process and get to market

616
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:17,550
faster, which is an easy one to

617
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,474
understand. So basically the translation

618
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:21,783
here is fewer support tickets equals

619
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:24,092
lower support labor costs, faster updates

620
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,401
equals reduced burden on SME's like

621
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,710
engineers, and lower content that need

622
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,018
means fewer reworking hours. These are

623
00:25:31,018 --> 00:25:33,577
all things they already know. They pay

624
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:36,120
for it, and they don't want to pay for

625
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,380
it. So my idea is in your organizations,

626
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,357
you should work to identify the things

627
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:42,617
they care about, map all of them, and

628
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:44,877
then do that translation. If I do this,

629
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,572
it equals the thing you want.

630
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:51,339
So my take away from this is use those

631
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:53,949
KPI or metrics, but with a context why

632
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:55,907
this happened, you reached this number,

633
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:58,517
but why this happened? What was the back

634
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:01,454
story of it? So this is one way to

635
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:04,391
do it. Yeah, Yeah, I can. I can I

636
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:07,327
join in just for a second to say let

637
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:10,007
me flip the coin. So that was about

638
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,239
saving things, right? And, and, and, and

639
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,470
while saving money means we didn't spend

640
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,339
it, so we still have it, it does not,

641
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:20,207
it does not, it does not mean that we

642
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:22,757
sold more, right? So we all know they

643
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:24,989
all, every leader probably wants to sell

644
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:26,901
more. They're probably very few leaders

645
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,849
whose job it is to sell less. All right,

646
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,716
maybe there's a use case for this, but I

647
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,263
can't think of it right now. But let's

648
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:37,174
say increasing revenue is important in

649
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:39,085
your documentation manager, what if the

650
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:41,314
metrics you collected were time to value

651
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:41,632
improvement?

652
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,249
Activation success, like you know, did

653
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:49,170
they set it up and turn it on and

654
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,117
get it, you know, going onboarding,

655
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:53,388
onboarding time, of course. And I mean

656
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:55,660
onboarding can even go a little further

657
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,607
into almost training, right? But but

658
00:26:57,607 --> 00:26:59,878
you're right, it's active. You have to

659
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:02,150
activate first in order to use the

660
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,778
product does do the AI. Sensor accuracy

661
00:27:04,778 --> 00:27:07,584
help reduce the sales and support

662
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,391
chat and calls. Does documentation driven

663
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:13,197
adoption signals, do they, are they

664
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:16,003
something that you can capture? And

665
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:18,810
then if you can, once they've

666
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,616
activated, now you have a profile

667
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:24,422
of a person that you know.

668
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,407
Came from the documentation, activated

669
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:29,046
the software, became a customer and are

670
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:31,685
continuing to pay you. So the translation

671
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:34,324
here is users adopt features faster and

672
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:36,586
stay longer when when they're equipped

673
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:38,471
with the right information. Support

674
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:41,110
agents closed the cases faster so they

675
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,748
spend less time on the phone, which

676
00:27:43,748 --> 00:27:46,457
means hypothetically. They can serve more

677
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,284
people in the same amount of

678
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:52,111
time. AI systems convert buyers to

679
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:54,467
prospective customers into customers by

680
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,823
answering questions correctly and giving

681
00:27:56,823 --> 00:27:59,650
them confidence that the brand they're

682
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,477
considering purchasing is a good one.

683
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:05,321
And better onboarding reduces churn. And

684
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:07,737
I've been Privy to sit in on sales calls

685
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:09,616
that software companies and let me tell

686
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:12,032
you that churn number is a pie chart and

687
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:14,448
some graphs that they do not want to see

688
00:28:14,448 --> 00:28:16,595
the chart get bigger in that area. They

689
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:19,011
want to see the chart get smaller in that

690
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:21,427
area. So we have to map our effort to

691
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:23,992
what they want. OK.

692
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:28,022
Right. And uh, I would

693
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:30,302
like to know, uh.

694
00:28:32,452 --> 00:28:35,073
Would you share some practical framework

695
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:37,693
or tools or approaches that teams

696
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:39,877
can adopt to measure documentation

697
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:42,497
surface metrics? I cannot. And that's

698
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:45,118
because there is no magic one

699
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:47,738
thing you have to build it

700
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:50,359
in all of this, the technical

701
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,084
documentation industry is a mishmash. Of

702
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:55,433
products and approaches that would never

703
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,783
be replicated. If anyone seriously wanted

704
00:28:57,783 --> 00:29:00,524
to produce content at scale and and

705
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:03,265
a sustainable way, we would never do

706
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:06,006
the things that we do because they

707
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:08,747
are not built to scale. They are

708
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,488
not designed to be sustainable. They are

709
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,741
not machine powered. Right. They're often

710
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,377
human labor and we're just used to it.

711
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:19,343
It's the way things work for so long. And

712
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:22,308
and now this segue is here. So I think

713
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:24,615
the most important thing is for technical

714
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:26,262
documentation, teams need to have

715
00:29:26,262 --> 00:29:27,910
universal agreed upon AI literacy

716
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,216
education. This is not about typing some

717
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:32,852
stuff in ChatGPT and having it spit back.

718
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:35,179
Some words This is about understanding

719
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:37,060
machine learning. This is about

720
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,316
understanding what the machine needs in

721
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:41,949
order to process the content and give

722
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,582
the right answers. This is about training

723
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,215
the system to not give answers that

724
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:49,847
are fake or hallucinated. This is about

725
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:52,480
constraining the system with our rules so

726
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,788
that a. Style Guide becomes an

727
00:29:54,788 --> 00:29:56,495
interactive tool that actually prevents

728
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:59,227
us from violating the rules. If we didn't

729
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:01,617
violate the rules, why would there need

730
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:02,982
to be a proofreader?

731
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:07,595
Right. So I feel like that tech writers

732
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:10,297
really we just need to get educated and

733
00:30:10,297 --> 00:30:12,662
we need, there's an emerging class of

734
00:30:12,662 --> 00:30:14,689
educators right now who are making

735
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:17,053
themselves known. You'll see a lot of

736
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:19,755
them in 2026 who will start to offer

737
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:22,120
classes. One of them is Bill Raymond.

738
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,822
Raymond, he goes by Bill the AI guy.

739
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:27,952
Or Bill Talks AI is what his podcast

740
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,194
is called. He offers classes specifically

741
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:32,063
for technical communicators and other

742
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,305
information developers on how to use

743
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:37,295
these tools to do their job. Not how

744
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:40,284
to use the tools to spit out content,

745
00:30:40,284 --> 00:30:43,274
but all the other things we do before

746
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,107
we get to that stage. And there's so

747
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:48,757
much that we do, but a lot of our leaders

748
00:30:48,757 --> 00:30:50,612
don't know that. So in order to.

749
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:53,757
Help them understand we could get better

750
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:55,941
trained. We could get trained, first of

751
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:58,437
all, and that training should be based on

752
00:30:58,437 --> 00:30:59,997
our content, operations, workflows. And

753
00:30:59,997 --> 00:31:01,869
each company is a little different.

754
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:04,054
That's why there's not a universal thing

755
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:06,862
you can do. It's going to be up to

756
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:09,358
the creativity of each one of the people

757
00:31:09,358 --> 00:31:10,918
that work on these technical

758
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:12,463
documentation teams. You know, maybe

759
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:13,965
today there's somebody who's really good

760
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:15,716
at grammar and punctuation, and you would

761
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:17,718
go to them because they just love that

762
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:19,720
it's who they are. And you know, they're

763
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,223
good at it and you can tell they like it.

764
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,974
But maybe there's also somebody on your

765
00:31:23,974 --> 00:31:25,976
team who's like, I don't know, is that

766
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:27,978
too much? Maybe it needs to be shorter,

767
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:29,480
right? And then there's another person

768
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,482
who says, why are we making it shorter?

769
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:33,544
We need more. These discussions still

770
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:36,278
need to occur on these teams, but

771
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:39,013
we can program agents to do that

772
00:31:39,013 --> 00:31:41,747
work. So on a Friday afternoon, you

773
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:44,481
could be ready to go to the

774
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:47,215
weekend with your family. You could push

775
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:49,949
a project to a set of agents

776
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,716
who act as technical communicators. They

777
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,977
could then debate which things should be

778
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,238
changed and why. They could create a

779
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:59,177
report and prioritize that report. They

780
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:02,084
could even make it into a PDF and send

781
00:32:02,084 --> 00:32:04,669
it to the person who cares. And they

782
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,930
would not need the whole weekend. You

783
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,192
could give them the whole weekend. Please

784
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:11,776
report to me back on Monday with the

785
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,938
following information. And they will, but

786
00:32:13,938 --> 00:32:16,790
they will be done in minutes, not days,

787
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,642
right? And that's what we need to kind

788
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:22,138
of start to think about as technical

789
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:24,633
communicators, how do we become part of

790
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:26,772
this process so that we're not

791
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:28,911
replaceable, but we're an integral part

792
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:31,050
of the machinations involved in producing

793
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,918
the experiences that we need?For our

794
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,432
customers to feel exceptionally treated.

795
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:41,464
I like your idea about the FBI

796
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:44,416
agents. So probably one of those agents

797
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,946
could also be an evaluator. Whatever

798
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:49,898
content or stuff that a agents, other

799
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:52,850
agents are generating, we would need to

800
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,802
test that. So probably that could also

801
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:58,332
happen by means of AI, which.

802
00:32:58,402 --> 00:33:01,365
Provides us a kind of a

803
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:04,327
single view of all the content

804
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:07,289
and whatever gaps it could find

805
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:10,017
so. Detailed evaluation available

806
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:12,775
to us say, uh, they are working through

807
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:15,532
the weekend and the human editor looks at

808
00:33:15,532 --> 00:33:18,290
it on a Monday and can make the

809
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,014
corrections quickly, something like that.

810
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:22,772
Would that make sense? And I also think

811
00:33:22,772 --> 00:33:25,185
that that we could give them monitoring

812
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:27,943
jobs. So for example, let's say that they

813
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:30,009
give us. Report on Monday morning and

814
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,082
then we tell them, hey, thank you, these

815
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:34,415
were great. We're not going to do #8 and

816
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:36,230
#9 because there's some changes in the

817
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,785
company's product that you're unaware of,

818
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:40,118
so we're not going to do those, but we're

819
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,192
going to do one through 6. Could you

820
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:44,266
please check next week on Monday to make

821
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:46,080
sure that all of our recommendations made

822
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,895
it back into the documentation and then

823
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:50,422
report to the. Manager if it did not.

824
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,601
Because again, humans can get sick. We

825
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:57,160
could forget, we can. Maybe it just slips

826
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,039
off of our radar and it's no longer part

827
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,277
of our priority. But the machine will

828
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:04,836
remember and can be an integral part in

829
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:07,395
helping us be successful. I do not want

830
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:10,273
it to be thought of as a replacement. It

831
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:12,770
needs to be thought of. As a

832
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,763
orchestrator, and therefore we become

833
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,357
orchestration experts. And that's

834
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:19,148
probably where our value lies. Because if

835
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:21,938
you think about it, once you understand

836
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:24,729
how to do that, you can orchestrate

837
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,519
any type of content because you don't

838
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,309
need to be a certain kind of

839
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:33,139
writer, you just need to. Understand all

840
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,820
the steps and how to make agents

841
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,352
help humans accomplish them.

842
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:41,344
That's great. Uh, last question

843
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:44,315
this regarding this, what are

844
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,286
your favorite AI tools and

845
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:50,257
platforms with which you create

846
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:53,228
your own AI workflows and

847
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:56,200
and also probably include evaluations

848
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,982
into those prompts?

849
00:34:59,582 --> 00:35:02,505
Promptitude so the word prompt. Think

850
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:05,427
of prompt and attitude as a

851
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,863
portmanteau. So promptitude and its

852
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:10,785
promptitude dot IO promptitude is what

853
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:13,708
could be described as a content

854
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:16,630
management system for prompts. Which begs

855
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,552
the question, should all of our.

856
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:21,203
Content management systems also manage

857
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,417
prompts. And the answer, of course, is

858
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,630
yes, they should. It is content. They

859
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,527
have audiences, they have variables, they

860
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,741
have conditions. We need to manage them

861
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:32,586
or we will find ourselves in a mess of

862
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:35,116
prompts. There's that. So I use that tool

863
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:37,013
because it is orchestration layer that

864
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:39,542
allows me to weave a bunch of tools.

865
00:35:39,632 --> 00:35:42,439
Together, I also use a tool

866
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:45,246
called Make in Between Tools. So

867
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:48,052
for example, in order to create

868
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:50,859
the webinars descriptions for the Content

869
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,666
Wrangler webinar series, I send a

870
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:56,472
prospective presenter a link to a

871
00:35:56,472 --> 00:35:59,279
Google form. The Google form asks

872
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:02,175
a few questions. Who are you? What is

873
00:36:02,175 --> 00:36:04,139
your e-mail address? What is your phone

874
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:06,384
number? What is your job title? And then

875
00:36:06,384 --> 00:36:07,786
maybe 3 questions about your

876
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:09,750
presentation. What do you think the name

877
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,714
of your presentation should be? What is

878
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:13,678
the reason why people should want to

879
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:15,361
watch your presentation? And maybe 3

880
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,325
things you expect that the viewers will

881
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:18,728
learn from your presentation. That

882
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,411
information then gets submitted into the

883
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,627
Google form. The Google form publishes

884
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:24,690
that into a Google Spreadsheet. The

885
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,752
Google Spreadsheet pushes it through make

886
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,158
Make puts it into promptitude, where my

887
00:36:29,158 --> 00:36:31,908
audiences are and my rules are and my

888
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:34,658
repurpose able content is. It then uses a

889
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:37,408
connection to an LM, whichever LM I want.

890
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,814
It doesn't matter which one you want,

891
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:42,052
whichever one you're subscribed to. And

892
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:44,452
then it would use that to generate the

893
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,552
content. And then it goes back through

894
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:48,652
make and goes back into the Google

895
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:50,152
spreadsheet and publishes the webinar

896
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:51,652
description. And then the spreadsheet

897
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:54,052
tells me that that's done from the time

898
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:56,752
that you push that button. It is like 3

899
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:58,852
minutes. And I have a webinar description

900
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:01,552
that I can at least look at and maybe.

901
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,395
Uh, review myself and make one or two

902
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:06,937
changes, but the amount of time it saves

903
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:09,161
is anywhere between 45 minutes and an

904
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:12,021
hour and a half every single time. And I

905
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,881
do 100 shows a year. And if you take

906
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,106
a billable rate times all those hours,

907
00:37:17,106 --> 00:37:19,966
you could see that as long as you spent

908
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:22,279
less than what you were spending. Before

909
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:24,636
you would make money. Well, my Google

910
00:37:24,636 --> 00:37:26,319
subscription is free. My make

911
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:28,676
subscription is like $15.00 a month. My

912
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:30,359
Promptitude subscription is maybe $39.00

913
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,052
a month. I did use some time. I

914
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:35,746
had to learn in order to do that.

915
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:38,439
I had to learn how to use each

916
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:41,132
one of those tools a little bit. So

917
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:44,062
there was some. Hours in there, but

918
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,732
let's say it cost me $1000

919
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,957
overall to produce 800 webinar

920
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:51,627
descriptions that used to cost me

921
00:37:51,627 --> 00:37:52,962
$24,000 a year.

922
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:57,587
One just one orchestration saved

923
00:37:57,587 --> 00:38:00,417
me $24,000. And to

924
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,794
be clear, I do not do that with

925
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,279
everything else. Everything else I'm

926
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:06,656
doing the hard way. I'm doing it exactly

927
00:38:06,656 --> 00:38:08,736
how everybody else does it. I'm writing

928
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:10,816
it myself. I'm making typos, I'm making

929
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:12,896
errors, I'm forgetting things. I sent it

930
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:15,273
to the wrong person. I make mistakes. But

931
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:17,353
when I have an orchestration layer, it

932
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:20,205
follows every step and when it breaks. It

933
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:22,952
stops and tells you it broke here.

934
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:26,878
And you can go back into the process

935
00:38:26,878 --> 00:38:28,982
and isolate where the the breakage

936
00:38:28,982 --> 00:38:31,086
occurred, repair the breakage, and then

937
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:33,892
get the process going again. That's why I

938
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:35,996
think we become choreographers of content

939
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:38,101
and orchestrators of the system because

940
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:40,906
our our true power is in getting the

941
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:43,712
results at the other end and we're smart

942
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,691
enough. We've learned how to extract

943
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,873
value from SME's. These AI systems are

944
00:38:47,873 --> 00:38:50,678
SME's. We have to learn what they need us

945
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:53,484
to learn in order to work with them, just

946
00:38:53,484 --> 00:38:56,289
like we have to learn how to work with

947
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,944
software developers. Yeah.

948
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:01,531
So that actually is the very

949
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:04,118
important KPI's of, you know, saving

950
00:39:04,118 --> 00:39:05,842
time and saving money.

951
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,754
That is the, you know, most important

952
00:39:09,754 --> 00:39:12,105
criteria that remains, uh, relevant even

953
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:14,847
today. So that's very innovative of you

954
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:17,589
to use all those tools together, and

955
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,330
I hope you also have some kind

956
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,072
of evaluation as part of your workload.

957
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:26,713
That's actually the longitude. The

958
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:28,490
Promptitude tool provides technical

959
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,156
writers with two free months of

960
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,932
access to the product.

961
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:36,506
People who come to the Content

962
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:38,267
wrangler.com blog and subscribe, you'll

963
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:40,732
be able to access some promotions that

964
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:43,198
will come out in 2026. After the

965
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:45,311
Christmas and New Year's holidays, we

966
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,424
will see some offers for technical

967
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:48,833
communicators. They're building and

968
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,242
Learning Center for technical

969
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:52,003
communicators to help them understand

970
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,820
what they need to learn in order to

971
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,532
master. All of these concepts and

972
00:39:57,532 --> 00:40:00,267
new methods and to answer your

973
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:03,002
question earlier about the tools. So

974
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:05,282
promptitude is the prompt management

975
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:08,017
system, but I also use a

976
00:40:08,017 --> 00:40:10,752
thing called Immerse, EMERSE Immerse dot

977
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,487
AI. Immerse is a platform that

978
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:16,222
allows you to generate delivery channels.

979
00:40:16,302 --> 00:40:19,024
That are identical human interfaces. So

980
00:40:19,024 --> 00:40:21,746
I made a clone of myself

981
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:24,468
called Steve Abel. And Steve Abel

982
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:27,189
was trained on DIDA, XML, technical

983
00:40:27,189 --> 00:40:29,004
documentation, single sourcing, content

984
00:40:29,004 --> 00:40:31,725
strategy, that kind of thing. And

985
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:34,447
he was also taught that when

986
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:37,169
the question is not, there's no

987
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:39,560
answer. In his database, he is not

988
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,346
allowed to go to the Internet and make up

989
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:45,131
an answer. He has to come back and 1st

990
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:47,917
do three things and it's a rule. First he

991
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,774
must compliment the person for their

992
00:40:49,774 --> 00:40:51,632
intelligent question, right? To make the

993
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:53,798
person feel good. And then the second

994
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:56,584
thing he must do is say oh you are

995
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,760
so smart, unlike Scott. The person who

996
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,888
programmed me, who did not give me that

997
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,750
information. So I cannot give you the

998
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,612
correct answer to that question. OK, See

999
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:05,942
right there, that avoids the

1000
00:41:05,942 --> 00:41:07,272
hallucination because they're giving you

1001
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:09,400
a I don't know answer, but we appended

1002
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,794
the I don't know answer with the best way

1003
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:14,454
for me to help you is to connect you with

1004
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:16,848
the human or maybe to push you to the

1005
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:18,710
support center or whatever you wanted it

1006
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,490
to be. That it would be not an

1007
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,667
hallucination. And the third thing it

1008
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,207
does is it provides this interface that

1009
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:28,747
is maybe creepy to people at first

1010
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:31,650
because we're getting used to the idea of

1011
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,827
seeing fake humans or virtual humans.

1012
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:36,367
They are increasingly good. I mean, they

1013
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:39,270
look better and better and better all the

1014
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,362
time. That maybe is a.

1015
00:41:42,172 --> 00:41:44,390
Stumbling block because not every

1016
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,052
consumer will want to have a

1017
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:49,714
human talking face deliver the content.

1018
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:52,375
But what if the delivery engine

1019
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:55,118
allowed you?As the

1020
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:57,384
customer to choose the delivery method

1021
00:41:57,384 --> 00:42:00,028
that you like, Would you like a

1022
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:02,673
fake person? Would you like a rather

1023
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:05,317
a cartoon character, like a dog that's

1024
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:07,961
animated to talk to you? Would you

1025
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:10,605
rather on the iPhone today when you

1026
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:13,249
talk to Siri, there is no person

1027
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:15,804
on your screen. They're simply a little

1028
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:18,064
graphic that spins around. So maybe we

1029
00:42:18,064 --> 00:42:19,678
become the delivery also channel

1030
00:42:19,678 --> 00:42:21,615
specialist, and then we provide the

1031
00:42:21,615 --> 00:42:24,198
ability for the consumer to tell us which

1032
00:42:24,198 --> 00:42:26,781
of those things, if any, they would like.

1033
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:29,364
Maybe they do not want a visual interface

1034
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:32,270
of any kind. They only want to hear the

1035
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,852
words. Maybe they want you to text them.

1036
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:37,809
The words, who knows? But it's

1037
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:40,696
all OK, it's all possible. Now,

1038
00:42:40,696 --> 00:42:43,583
once we map out the process

1039
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,470
and we isolate every granular step

1040
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:49,357
and the if then if this,

1041
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:52,244
then that arguments along the way,

1042
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:55,131
we'll have a powerful very knowledge

1043
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:57,836
intensive. Which means we will be

1044
00:42:57,836 --> 00:43:00,822
valued for our expertise. Role took play.

1045
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:06,542
That to me, so virtual, uh, Altas

1046
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,532
seems very clever and fun way of

1047
00:43:09,532 --> 00:43:12,095
interacting with the audiences and also

1048
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,230
delivering health content. Probably we

1049
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,220
might be able to see some of

1050
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,210
those in, uh, you know, uh, a

1051
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,345
user documentation delivery someday, I

1052
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:24,882
hope. You just demonstrated

1053
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,782
them at the Convex conference live,

1054
00:43:27,782 --> 00:43:30,682
so it's a possibility today I'll

1055
00:43:30,682 --> 00:43:33,582
be doing another one in February

1056
00:43:33,582 --> 00:43:36,482
in Brussels, Belgium at the To

1057
00:43:36,482 --> 00:43:38,899
the Europe conference. We'll be

1058
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:41,799
delivering a an interactive bot that

1059
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,493
has been trained on. Technical

1060
00:43:44,493 --> 00:43:46,359
documentation created and they did a

1061
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:48,535
authoring tool and managed in a component

1062
00:43:48,535 --> 00:43:50,090
content management system and published

1063
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,577
to the web. We will have snatched the

1064
00:43:52,577 --> 00:43:54,754
content from the web, not from anywhere

1065
00:43:54,754 --> 00:43:57,241
else, but from the web pages, and then

1066
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:59,729
we'll process it and we'll be able to

1067
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:02,527
talk about why you would want to do that,

1068
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:04,804
what was involved in doing that. And

1069
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:07,521
whether you would want to do it in the

1070
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,937
future, what could you expect to need to

1071
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:12,352
know? What would you need to pay for,

1072
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:14,465
what kind of expertise is required and

1073
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:16,579
what are the risks? Because there are

1074
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:18,390
still risks to deploying this technology,

1075
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,107
we have to be very cautious to not let

1076
00:44:21,107 --> 00:44:23,522
it run about run amok on its own.

1077
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:27,682
Yeah, that's very interesting.

1078
00:44:29,022 --> 00:44:31,946
Uh, moving forward, uh, what do

1079
00:44:31,946 --> 00:44:34,870
you think as the next frontier

1080
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,332
for documentation success?

1081
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,861
I mean, I think it's the same thing I've

1082
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:43,734
been saying. It's really about us

1083
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:45,606
understanding that we're no longer just

1084
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:47,479
writers, that for years we've been

1085
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:49,040
responsible for doing things like

1086
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,600
deciding what metadata would be

1087
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,097
appropriate. But most of the time we did

1088
00:44:53,097 --> 00:44:55,906
it for ourselves. We didn't do it for our

1089
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:58,402
machine. We did it so that we could.

1090
00:44:58,472 --> 00:45:00,872
Produce an HTML version and a PDF version

1091
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:03,272
and a help site version from the same

1092
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:05,072
source of content. Because they wouldn't

1093
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:07,772
give us 5 new riders to do that, right?

1094
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:09,272
And they wouldn't. They wouldn't

1095
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:11,372
magically give us money just because we

1096
00:45:11,372 --> 00:45:13,172
wanted to support new channels. They,

1097
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:15,872
they said figure it out, right? And so we

1098
00:45:15,872 --> 00:45:18,572
did. We figured it out the best way we

1099
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:20,972
knew how. Our industry, by the way,

1100
00:45:20,972 --> 00:45:22,987
created much of the standardization that

1101
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,674
is valuable today in the XML world. These

1102
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:28,361
AI company leaders, when they come to me

1103
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:30,712
and then they understand after I tell

1104
00:45:30,712 --> 00:45:33,399
them how we create content in a modern

1105
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,743
technical documentation factory, they

1106
00:45:34,743 --> 00:45:37,094
say, ohh, thank goodness you used the

1107
00:45:37,094 --> 00:45:38,773
dinner specification because it isolates

1108
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:41,644
each piece of the content. It says this

1109
00:45:41,644 --> 00:45:43,864
is the procedure, this is the concepts,

1110
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:46,083
these are the references. So if people

1111
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,620
don't ask for references, the AI will not

1112
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,840
deliver references. If the AI is only

1113
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,060
asked for the procedure, it will only

1114
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,280
deliver the procedure. I think this is

1115
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,500
the important thing. We can help make

1116
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,037
sure that the content is delivered is the

1117
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:02,438
content that was asked for. And our

1118
00:46:02,438 --> 00:46:04,556
markup is what provides that. And so

1119
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,673
companies that are trying to cheap out

1120
00:46:06,673 --> 00:46:09,094
and not invest in markup will find that

1121
00:46:09,094 --> 00:46:11,514
the machine will have to guess, and the

1122
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:13,632
guessing is where the risk is introduced.

1123
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:18,876
Scott, thank you for sharing your

1124
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,452
insights. This has been a truly

1125
00:46:21,452 --> 00:46:23,598
fascinating look at the evolving

1126
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:25,316
landscape of technical communication,

1127
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,033
particularly how documentation success

1128
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:29,609
metrics are shifting in the age

1129
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:32,185
of AI. Your insights highlight that

1130
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:34,761
true documentation success now hinges on

1131
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:37,217
content being structured. And being

1132
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:39,789
governed so that it can be

1133
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:42,362
passed and trusted by machines and

1134
00:46:42,362 --> 00:46:44,505
that our metrics must measure

1135
00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:46,649
effectiveness such as first contact

1136
00:46:46,649 --> 00:46:49,221
resolution accuracy and map directly to

1137
00:46:49,221 --> 00:46:51,365
high level business goals including

1138
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:53,508
reducing operational costs and increasing

1139
00:46:53,508 --> 00:46:56,081
revenue. Thanks again, Scott for showing
